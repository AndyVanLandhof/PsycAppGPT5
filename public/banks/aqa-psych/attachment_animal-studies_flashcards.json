    {
      "question": "What is attachment in psychology?",
      "answer": "Attachment is a strong emotional bond between an infant and caregiver, crucial for development.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define imprinting in the context of attachment.",
      "answer": "Imprinting is a rapid learning process by which a newborn animal establishes a behavior pattern of recognition and attraction to another animal or object, typically occurring shortly after birth.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Lorenz (1935) study about attachment?",
      "answer": "Lorenz (1935) studied imprinting in geese, finding that goslings followed the first moving object they saw, demonstrating that attachment is innate and occurs during a critical period.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Harlow (1958) find about attachment in monkeys?",
      "answer": "Harlow (1958) found that infant monkeys preferred cloth surrogate mothers over wire ones, highlighting the importance of comfort in attachment over mere provision of food.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'critical period' in attachment theory.",
      "answer": "The critical period is a specific time during which an organism is particularly responsive to environmental influences, crucial for forming attachments.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of Harlow's monkey studies?",
      "answer": "Harlow's studies demonstrated that emotional comfort and security are more crucial than food in forming attachments, challenging the learning theory of attachment.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Harlow conclude about the effects of maternal deprivation?",
      "answer": "Harlow concluded that maternal deprivation led to social and emotional problems in monkeys, suggesting similar effects could occur in humans.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'innate' in the context of attachment.",
      "answer": "Innate refers to characteristics or behaviors that are present from birth, not learned, and typically imply a biological basis.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Lorenz conclude about the nature of attachment?",
      "answer": "Lorenz concluded that attachment is an innate process that occurs during a critical period, essential for survival.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Harlow's research impact understanding of human attachment?",
      "answer": "Harlow's research underscored the importance of emotional care and comfort, influencing child-rearing practices and attachment theory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Lorenz's geese study demonstrate about attachment?",
      "answer": "Lorenz's study demonstrated that attachment is an automatic process occurring in a critical period, with long-term effects on social behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'social learning theory' in the context of attachment.",
      "answer": "Social learning theory suggests that attachment behaviors are learned through observation and imitation of others.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Harlow's study apply to understanding parenting?",
      "answer": "Harlow's study highlights the importance of providing comfort and nurturing to infants, suggesting that emotional care is crucial in parenting.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Lorenz's findings to a scenario where a child shows attachment to a toy.",
      "answer": "Similar to Lorenz's geese, a child may form an attachment to a toy if it is consistently present and comforting, demonstrating attachment during a critical period.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How might Harlow's findings influence childcare practices?",
      "answer": "Harlow's findings suggest childcare practices should prioritize emotional warmth and security over mere provision of physical needs like food.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of imprinting to a pet bonding with its owner.",
      "answer": "Imprinting can explain why a pet, like a duckling, might follow and bond with its owner if they are present during the critical early period.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of Lorenz's animal study on attachment.",
      "answer": "Lorenz's study provided strong evidence for the concept of imprinting, highlighting the biological basis of attachment.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Harlow's 1958 study.",
      "answer": "Harlow's study was criticized for ethical issues due to the distress caused to monkeys, but it provided valuable insights into the nature of attachment.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of using animal studies to explain human attachment.",
      "answer": "Animal studies may not fully generalize to humans due to differences in complexity of social behavior and cognition between species.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the ecological validity of Lorenz's study.",
      "answer": "Lorenz's study might lack ecological validity as it was conducted in an artificial setting, which may not accurately reflect natural behavior.",
