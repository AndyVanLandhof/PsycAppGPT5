    {
      "question": "What is attachment in the context of psychology?",
      "answer": "Attachment is a deep and enduring emotional bond between two individuals, typically between a child and caregiver, characterized by a desire for closeness and security.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define imprinting in animal studies.",
      "answer": "Imprinting is a rapid form of learning occurring in a critical period, where a young animal forms an attachment to the first moving object it sees.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Lorenz (1935) find about imprinting in geese?",
      "answer": "Lorenz found that geese imprinted on the first moving object they saw, which was either their mother or Lorenz himself, demonstrating a critical period for attachment.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Harlow (1958) find about contact comfort in monkeys?",
      "answer": "Harlow found that infant monkeys preferred a cloth surrogate mother over a wire one, even when the wire mother provided food, highlighting the importance of contact comfort in attachment.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'critical period' in attachment.",
      "answer": "The critical period is a specific time in development when an organism is particularly sensitive to certain environmental stimuli, crucial for forming attachments.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Harlow's studies suggest about the role of food in attachment?",
      "answer": "Harlow's studies suggested that food is less important than comfort and security in forming attachments, as shown by monkeys preferring cloth surrogates over wire ones providing food.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main finding of Lorenz's study on imprinting?",
      "answer": "Lorenz's study found that goslings imprinted on the first moving object they saw, showing that attachment is innate and occurs during a critical period.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does 'innate' mean in the context of attachment?",
      "answer": "Innate refers to behaviors or traits that are present from birth and not learned, suggesting a biological basis for attachment.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Harlow conclude about the effects of maternal deprivation?",
      "answer": "Harlow concluded that maternal deprivation leads to emotional and social difficulties, as monkeys raised without a real mother showed abnormal behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the 'wire mother' play in Harlow's study?",
      "answer": "The wire mother in Harlow's study provided food but lacked comfort, illustrating that attachment is more influenced by emotional needs than by feeding.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'privation' in attachment studies.",
      "answer": "Privation refers to the absence of any attachment bond, often leading to severe developmental and emotional issues if not addressed early.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Harlow's study reveal about the importance of early attachments?",
      "answer": "Harlow's study revealed that early attachments are crucial for healthy social and emotional development, as seen in the maladjustment of monkeys without maternal figures.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Lorenz's concept of imprinting apply to this scenario: A chick follows a human as soon as it hatches.",
      "answer": "The chick has imprinted on the human, demonstrating that imprinting occurs during a critical period and results in attachment to the first moving object seen.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Harlow's findings to this scenario: A child seeks comfort from a parent during distress rather than a stranger with a toy.",
      "answer": "Harlow's findings suggest that the child values the parent's comfort over material offerings, highlighting the importance of emotional security in attachment.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does imprinting explain a duckling following a dog instead of its mother?",
      "answer": "The duckling imprinted on the dog during its critical period, showing that imprinting can occur with species other than its own if they are the first moving object seen.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Harlow's study to this scenario: A child prefers a worn-out blanket over a new toy.",
      "answer": "Harlow's study indicates that the child's preference for the blanket over a toy illustrates the significance of comfort and familiarity in attachment.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of Harlow's study on attachment.",
      "answer": "One strength is the study's influence on understanding the importance of caregiving and emotional security in child development, impacting childcare practices.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Lorenz's imprinting study.",
      "answer": "Lorenz's study has high ecological validity due to its naturalistic observation of geese, but findings may not generalize to humans due to species differences.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of Harlow's study on attachment.",
      "answer": "A limitation is the ethical concerns due to the psychological harm inflicted on monkeys, raising questions about the study's moral justification.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Harlow's research.",
      "answer": "Harlow's research provided controlled conditions to isolate variables, but ethical issues regarding animal welfare and lack of ecological validity are significant critiques.",
      "ao": "AO3"
