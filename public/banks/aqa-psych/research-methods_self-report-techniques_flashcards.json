      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an open question?",
      "answer": "An open question allows participants to respond freely, providing qualitative data that is rich in detail.",
      "ao": "AO1"

    {
      "question": "Define social desirability bias.",
      "answer": "Social desirability bias occurs when participants respond in a manner they believe is socially acceptable rather than truthfully.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does social desirability bias apply to this scenario: Participants report their frequency of exercise?",
      "answer": "Participants may over-report their exercise frequency to align with societal norms that value fitness and health.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of leading questions to this scenario: 'You enjoy exercise, don't you?'",
      "answer": "The question assumes a positive response, possibly leading participants to agree, affecting the validity of the data.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does interviewer bias apply to this scenario: An interviewer nods approvingly?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Apply response bias to this scenario: Participants consistently choose the middle option on a scale.",

    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Kvale's (1996) interview research.",
      "answer": "Kvale's emphasis on interviewer skill suggests potential variability in data quality, affecting reliability across different interviewers.",
