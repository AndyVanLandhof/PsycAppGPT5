    {
      "question": "What is OCD?",
      "answer": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by unwanted, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions).",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define obsessions in the context of OCD.",
      "answer": "Obsessions are persistent, intrusive thoughts, impulses, or images that cause significant anxiety or distress in individuals with OCD.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define compulsions in the context of OCD.",
      "answer": "Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, aimed at reducing anxiety.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Menzies et al. (2007) find about brain structure in OCD?",
      "answer": "Menzies et al. (2007) found that individuals with OCD have lower grey matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting a neurological basis for the disorder.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of serotonin in OCD?",
      "answer": "Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter, are associated with OCD, affecting mood and anxiety regulation, contributing to the disorder's symptoms.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the genetic explanation for OCD?",
      "answer": "The genetic explanation suggests that OCD may be inherited, with evidence from twin studies indicating higher concordance rates in monozygotic twins.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Soomro et al. (2008) find about SSRIs and OCD?",
      "answer": "Soomro et al. (2008) found that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in reducing OCD symptoms, supporting the role of serotonin in the disorder.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'neural explanation' in OCD.",
      "answer": "Neural explanations focus on the role of brain structures and neurotransmitters in OCD, such as abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex and serotonin dysfunction.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the two-process model in the context of OCD?",
      "answer": "The two-process model explains OCD through classical conditioning (acquisition of obsessions) and operant conditioning (maintenance through compulsions).",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are SSRIs, and how are they used in treating OCD?",
      "answer": "Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are antidepressants that increase serotonin levels, used to reduce OCD symptoms by improving mood and anxiety.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Nestadt et al. (2010) find about OCD heredity?",
      "answer": "Nestadt et al. (2010) found that first-degree relatives of OCD patients have a higher risk of developing the disorder, supporting genetic factors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is ERP in the context of OCD treatment?",
      "answer": "Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is a behavioral therapy for OCD involving exposure to obsessive thoughts and prevention of compulsive responses.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the two-process model apply to a person who checks locks repeatedly?",
      "answer": "The obsession with safety (classical conditioning) leads to anxiety, and checking locks (compulsion) reduces anxiety, reinforcing the behavior (operant conditioning).",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply ERP to this scenario: A person avoids public places to prevent contamination.",
      "answer": "ERP would involve gradual exposure to public places while preventing the compulsive behavior of avoidance, reducing anxiety over time.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the genetic explanation of OCD be applied to a family with multiple cases?",
      "answer": "If several family members have OCD, it suggests a genetic predisposition, making it likely that the disorder is inherited within the family.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the neural explanation to a case where brain imaging shows abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex.",
      "answer": "The abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex indicate a neural basis for OCD symptoms, potentially leading to obsessive and compulsive behaviors.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of using SSRIs to treat OCD.",
      "answer": "SSRIs are effective in reducing OCD symptoms in many patients, providing a non-invasive treatment option that can improve quality of life.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the genetic explanation for OCD.",
      "answer": "The genetic explanation does not account for environmental factors that may trigger or exacerbate OCD symptoms, limiting its comprehensiveness.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Soomro et al. (2008) in their study on SSRIs.",
      "answer": "Soomro et al. (2008) used meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, providing high-quality evidence but may suffer from publication bias.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the neural explanation for OCD.",
      "answer": "The neural explanation may be reductionist, oversimplifying complex behaviors by attributing them solely to brain structures and neurotransmitters.",
      "ao": "AO3"
