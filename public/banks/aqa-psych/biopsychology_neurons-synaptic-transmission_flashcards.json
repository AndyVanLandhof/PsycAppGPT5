    {
      "question": "What is a neuron?",
      "answer": "A neuron is a specialized cell that transmits electrical and chemical signals in the nervous system.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define synapse.",
      "answer": "A synapse is the junction between two neurons, where neurotransmitters are released to transmit signals.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is synaptic transmission?",
      "answer": "Synaptic transmission is the process of transferring information from one neuron to another at a synapse.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Otto Loewi (1921) discover about neurotransmission?",
      "answer": "Otto Loewi discovered that neurotransmission involves chemical messengers by demonstrating that acetylcholine could slow heart rate.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define action potential.",
      "answer": "Action potential is a rapid rise and fall in electrical charge across a neuron's membrane, leading to signal transmission.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of neurotransmitters?",
      "answer": "Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron to another.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of the myelin sheath?",
      "answer": "The myelin sheath insulates axons, speeding up the transmission of electrical impulses along the neuron.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define reuptake.",
      "answer": "Reuptake is the process by which neurotransmitters are reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron after transmission.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of the axon terminal?",
      "answer": "The axon terminal releases neurotransmitters into the synapse to transmit signals to the next neuron.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Sherrington (1906) find about synapses?",
      "answer": "Sherrington found that synapses are specialized for chemical transmission, suggesting a delay in signal transmission.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define excitatory neurotransmitter.",
      "answer": "An excitatory neurotransmitter increases the likelihood that the receiving neuron will generate an action potential.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an inhibitory neurotransmitter?",
      "answer": "An inhibitory neurotransmitter decreases the likelihood of the neuron firing an action potential.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply synaptic transmission to this scenario: A student is studying and suddenly feels alert after drinking coffee.",
      "answer": "Caffeine increases the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, enhancing alertness by increasing synaptic transmission.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does reuptake inhibition apply to antidepressants?",
      "answer": "Antidepressants like SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, increasing its availability in the synapse, improving mood.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of action potential to a reflex action.",
      "answer": "In a reflex action, a stimulus triggers action potentials that travel along sensory neurons to the spinal cord, initiating a response.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the myelin sheath apply to multiple sclerosis?",
      "answer": "In multiple sclerosis, the degradation of the myelin sheath slows down nerve impulse transmission, causing motor and sensory impairments.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the chemical synapse model.",
      "answer": "The chemical synapse model explains the specificity of neurotransmitter actions, allowing targeted drug development for mental health disorders.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of synaptic transmission research.",
      "answer": "Many synaptic transmission studies are conducted on animals, which may not fully generalize to human synaptic processes.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Loewi's (1921) study.",
      "answer": "Loewi's study was groundbreaking but limited by its simplistic and indirect measurement of neurotransmitter effects on heart rate.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of using action potentials to study neuron function.",
      "answer": "Action potentials provide objective, quantifiable data on neural activity, allowing precise measurement of neuronal response to stimuli.",
      "ao": "AO3"
