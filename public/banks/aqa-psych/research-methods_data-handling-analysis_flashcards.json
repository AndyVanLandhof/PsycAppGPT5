    {
      "question": "What is a case study?",
      "answer": "A case study is an in-depth investigation of an individual, group, or event, providing detailed qualitative data.",
      "ao": "AO1"

    {
      "question": "Define independent variable.",
      "answer": "An independent variable is the variable manipulated by the researcher to observe its effect on the dependent variable.",

    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of operationalization to this scenario: Measuring stress in students.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does counterbalancing apply to repeated measures designs?",
      "answer": "Counterbalancing is used in repeated measures designs to control for order effects by varying the sequence of conditions for participants.",
