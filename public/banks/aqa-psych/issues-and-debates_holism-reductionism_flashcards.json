    {
      "question": "What is holism in psychology?",
      "answer": "Holism is an approach that emphasizes the whole experience rather than individual components, suggesting that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define reductionism in psychology.",
      "answer": "Reductionism is the approach of breaking down complex phenomena into simpler components, often focusing on a single level of explanation, such as biological or cognitive.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Sperry (1968) find about split-brain patients?",
      "answer": "Sperry found that split-brain patients could only verbally identify objects presented to the right visual field, demonstrating lateralization of brain function.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is biological reductionism?",
      "answer": "Biological reductionism is the attempt to explain psychological phenomena in terms of biological processes like genetics, neurochemicals, and brain structures.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define environmental reductionism.",
      "answer": "Environmental reductionism explains behavior in terms of simple stimulus-response links, focusing on observable behavior and omitting mental processes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bartlett (1932) find about memory?",
      "answer": "Bartlett found that memory is reconstructive, influenced by social and cultural factors, suggesting a holistic approach to understanding cognitive processes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Gestalt psychology's contribution to holism?",
      "answer": "Gestalt psychology emphasizes viewing psychological phenomena as structured wholes, asserting that perception and cognition are best understood holistically.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define levels of explanation in psychology.",
      "answer": "Levels of explanation refer to the different ways of understanding behavior, ranging from broad, holistic approaches to detailed, reductionist ones.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the interactionist approach?",
      "answer": "The interactionist approach combines multiple levels of explanation to provide a more comprehensive understanding of psychological phenomena.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Pavlov's (1927) classical conditioning study demonstrate?",
      "answer": "Pavlov's study demonstrated that dogs could learn to associate a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, showing environmental reductionism through stimulus-response learning.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bandura's (1961) Bobo doll study find?",
      "answer": "Bandura found that children imitated aggressive behavior observed in adults, supporting social learning theory and illustrating environmental influences on behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define methodological reductionism.",
      "answer": "Methodological reductionism involves breaking down complex behaviors into simpler components for experimental analysis, often using controlled laboratory settings.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does reductionism apply to treating depression?",
      "answer": "In treating depression, reductionism might focus on altering neurochemical imbalances using medication, rather than considering holistic factors like social support or lifestyle.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply holism to this scenario: A child struggling in school.",
      "answer": "Holism would consider the child's overall life context, including emotional well-being, family dynamics, social environment, and educational support, to understand their struggles.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does holism apply to understanding schizophrenia?",
      "answer": "A holistic approach to schizophrenia might integrate biological, psychological, and social factors, considering how these interact to influence symptoms and treatment outcomes.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply reductionism to this scenario: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).",
      "answer": "Reductionism might explain OCD through specific neural pathways or serotonin levels, focusing on biological treatment options like medication.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of holism.",
      "answer": "Holism provides a more complete understanding of behavior by considering multiple factors and their interactions, which can lead to more effective interventions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of reductionism.",
      "answer": "Reductionism may oversimplify complex behaviors, neglecting the influence of social and environmental factors, which can lead to incomplete explanations.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Bandura's (1961) Bobo doll study.",
      "answer": "Bandura's study was criticized for artificiality and lack of ecological validity, as it was conducted in a lab setting that may not reflect real-life aggression.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Sperry's (1968) split-brain research.",
      "answer": "Sperry's research had high control and provided valuable insights into lateralization, but the small, unique sample limits generalizability to the wider population.",
