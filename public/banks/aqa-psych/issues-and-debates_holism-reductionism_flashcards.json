    {
      "question": "What is a criticism of reductionism?",
      "answer": "Reductionism may oversimplify complex behaviors, ignoring social and cultural factors that influence behavior.",

      "question": "How does holism apply to understanding depression?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Apply reductionism to this scenario: A child develops a phobia of dogs.",

    {
      "question": "How does interactionism apply to schizophrenia?",
      "answer": "Interactionism suggests that schizophrenia results from an interplay of genetic vulnerability and environmental stressors, such as family dynamics.",

    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of reductionism.",
      "answer": "Reductionism may fail to account for the complexity of human behavior, potentially leading to incomplete explanations and interventions.",
