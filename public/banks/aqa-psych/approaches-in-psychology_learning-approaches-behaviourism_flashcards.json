    {
      "question": "What is classical conditioning?",
      "answer": "Classical conditioning is a learning process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a conditioned response.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define operant conditioning.",
      "answer": "Operant conditioning is a type of learning where behavior is controlled by consequences such as rewards and punishments.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Pavlov (1927) find about classical conditioning?",
      "answer": "Pavlov found that dogs could learn to associate a neutral stimulus (bell) with an unconditioned stimulus (food) to produce a conditioned response (salivation).",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define reinforcement in the context of operant conditioning.",
      "answer": "Reinforcement is any consequence that strengthens or increases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is positive reinforcement?",
      "answer": "Positive reinforcement involves adding a pleasant stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is negative reinforcement?",
      "answer": "Negative reinforcement involves removing an unpleasant stimulus to increase the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Skinner (1948) find about operant conditioning?",
      "answer": "Skinner found that rats in a Skinner box could learn to press a lever to receive food, demonstrating reinforcement as a key aspect of operant conditioning.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define punishment in the context of operant conditioning.",
      "answer": "Punishment is a consequence that decreases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a primary reinforcer?",
      "answer": "A primary reinforcer is a naturally reinforcing stimulus, such as food or water, that satisfies a basic biological need.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a secondary reinforcer?",
      "answer": "A secondary reinforcer is a stimulus that gains its reinforcing power through association with a primary reinforcer, such as money.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define extinction in classical conditioning.",
      "answer": "Extinction occurs when a conditioned response diminishes because the conditioned stimulus is no longer paired with the unconditioned stimulus.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is spontaneous recovery in classical conditioning?",
      "answer": "Spontaneous recovery is the reappearance of a previously extinguished conditioned response after a rest period.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does classical conditioning apply to phobias?",
      "answer": "Phobias can develop when a neutral stimulus is paired with a frightening event, causing the neutral stimulus to elicit a fear response.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply operant conditioning to this scenario: a child completes homework to earn extra playtime.",
      "answer": "The extra playtime acts as positive reinforcement, increasing the likelihood that the child will complete homework in the future.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does negative reinforcement apply to this scenario: a student studies to avoid failing?",
      "answer": "The removal of the threat of failing acts as negative reinforcement, increasing the likelihood of the student studying in the future.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply punishment to this scenario: a teenager is grounded for breaking curfew.",
      "answer": "Being grounded is a form of punishment intended to decrease the likelihood of the teenager breaking curfew again.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the behaviourist approach.",
      "answer": "A strength is its scientific rigor; behaviourism relies on controlled experiments and observable behavior, enhancing objectivity and replicability.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the behaviourist approach.",
      "answer": "A limitation is its neglect of mental processes; it overlooks cognitive factors that contribute to behavior, providing an incomplete understanding.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Pavlov's (1927) study.",
      "answer": "Pavlov's study is criticized for ethical issues regarding the treatment of animals and limited generalizability to human behavior.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Skinner's (1948) study.",
      "answer": "Skinner's study is valued for its controlled environment but criticized for ethical concerns and lack of ecological validity.",
      "ao": "AO3"
