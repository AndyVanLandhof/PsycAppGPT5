    {
      "question": "What is Social Learning Theory?",
      "answer": "Social Learning Theory (SLT) suggests people learn through observation, imitation, and modeling of others within a social context.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'vicarious reinforcement' in SLT.",
      "answer": "Vicarious reinforcement occurs when an individual observes another being rewarded for a behavior, increasing the likelihood of the observer imitating that behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bandura et al. (1961) find about aggression?",
      "answer": "Bandura et al. (1961) found children exposed to aggressive models were more likely to imitate aggressive behaviors than those who observed non-aggressive models.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'modeling' in the context of SLT.",
      "answer": "Modeling in SLT involves observing and imitating the behavior of a role model, which can lead to learning new behaviors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does 'identification' play in SLT?",
      "answer": "Identification occurs when an observer relates to a model and is more likely to imitate their behavior due to perceived similarities.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'attention' in Bandura's SLT?",
      "answer": "Attention is the first process in SLT where an individual focuses on a model's behavior to learn it effectively.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bandura propose about 'retention'?",
      "answer": "Retention involves storing observed behaviors in memory for later reproduction, a key process in SLT.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'motor reproduction' in SLT.",
      "answer": "Motor reproduction is the process of physically replicating an observed behavior, requiring the observer to have the ability to perform the behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'motivation' in SLT?",
      "answer": "Motivation in SLT refers to the reasons or incentives for reproducing an observed behavior, often influenced by expected rewards or punishments.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bandura et al. (1963) find about media influences?",
      "answer": "Bandura et al. (1963) found children who watched aggressive behavior on film were more likely to imitate it than those who saw non-aggressive behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'self-efficacy' in SLT.",
      "answer": "Self-efficacy in SLT refers to an individual's belief in their capability to perform a behavior successfully.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bandura (1977) contribute to SLT?",
      "answer": "Bandura (1977) emphasized the cognitive processes involved in learning, such as attention and motivation, highlighting SLT's role beyond simple imitation.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply SLT to this scenario: A child refuses to clean their room despite being told to.",
      "answer": "The child may not have an effective model showing the benefits of cleaning, or they may not identify with or be attentive to the model provided.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does SLT explain a teenager imitating a celebrity's behavior?",
      "answer": "The teenager likely identifies with the celebrity and observes the rewards (e.g., status, admiration) they receive, leading to vicarious reinforcement.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply SLT to this scenario: A student volunteers after seeing a peer praised for helping.",
      "answer": "The student experiences vicarious reinforcement, observing the peer's praise and deciding to imitate the helpful behavior to gain similar rewards.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does SLT apply to learning cultural norms?",
      "answer": "Individuals learn cultural norms through observing and imitating behaviors of others in their community, reinforced by social acceptance and approval.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of Social Learning Theory.",
      "answer": "SLT integrates cognitive processes with behavioral learning, providing a more comprehensive understanding of learning compared to behaviorism alone.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of Social Learning Theory.",
      "answer": "SLT may underestimate the influence of biological factors, such as genetic predispositions, in shaping behaviors.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Bandura et al. (1961).",
      "answer": "Bandura et al.'s lab study allowed for control over variables, increasing reliability, but it may lack ecological validity due to the artificial setting.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Bandura et al. (1963).",
      "answer": "While the study demonstrated media influence on aggression, it used artificial stimuli and may not reflect real-world media exposure accurately.",
      "ao": "AO3"
