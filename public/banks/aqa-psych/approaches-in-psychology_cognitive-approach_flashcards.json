    {
      "question": "What is the cognitive approach in psychology?",
      "answer": "The cognitive approach focuses on understanding mental processes like memory, perception, and problem-solving, interpreting them as information processing similar to a computer.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'schema' within the cognitive approach.",
      "answer": "A schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information, influencing attention and memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the information processing model?",
      "answer": "It is a model likening the mind to a computer, involving input, processing, storage, and output of information.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bartlett (1932) find about memory?",
      "answer": "Bartlett found that memory is reconstructive and influenced by existing knowledge and schemas, as shown in his 'War of the Ghosts' study.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'cognitive neuroscience.'",
      "answer": "Cognitive neuroscience is the study of brain structures and their involvement in mental processes, combining cognitive psychology with neuroscience.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of computer models in cognitive psychology?",
      "answer": "Computer models simulate human cognitive processes, helping to understand and predict mental functions through computational algorithms.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Loftus and Palmer (1974) find about eyewitness testimony?",
      "answer": "They found that the wording of questions can distort eyewitness memory, suggesting memory is malleable and not always accurate.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'cognitive biases.'",
      "answer": "Cognitive biases are systematic errors in thinking, affecting judgments and decisions, often due to heuristics and preconceptions.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of theoretical models in cognitive psychology?",
      "answer": "Theoretical models provide frameworks for understanding complex cognitive processes, guiding research and hypothesis testing.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Baddeley and Hitch (1974) propose about working memory?",
      "answer": "They proposed the working memory model, comprising a central executive, phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, and episodic buffer.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'cognitive therapy.'",
      "answer": "Cognitive therapy is a type of psychotherapy aimed at changing negative patterns of thinking to improve emotional regulation and behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Piaget (1952) propose about cognitive development?",
      "answer": "Piaget proposed that cognitive development occurs in stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational, each characterized by different cognitive abilities.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does cognitive dissonance apply to decision making?",
      "answer": "Cognitive dissonance occurs when one's beliefs conflict with actions, often leading to changes in beliefs or attitudes to reduce discomfort.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of schemas to this scenario: A child sees a zebra and calls it a horse.",
      "answer": "The child uses an existing horse schema to interpret the zebra, showing assimilation. With more exposure, they will accommodate and create a new schema for zebras.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the cognitive approach explain depression?",
      "answer": "The cognitive approach suggests depression results from negative thinking patterns and cognitive distortions, leading to maladaptive behaviors and emotions.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the information processing model to learning a new language.",
      "answer": "Input involves listening and reading, processing includes understanding grammar and vocabulary, storage is memorization, and output is speaking and writing.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the cognitive approach.",
      "answer": "It is scientific, using controlled experiments to study mental processes, providing empirical support and advancing understanding of cognitive functions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the cognitive approach.",
      "answer": "It can be criticized for being overly mechanical, ignoring emotions and social factors in human cognition, leading to incomplete explanations.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Loftus and Palmer (1974).",
      "answer": "The study used a lab experiment, allowing control over variables and replication, but it lacks ecological validity as it may not reflect real-life memory accuracy.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Bartlett (1932).",
      "answer": "Bartlett's use of naturalistic tasks increases ecological validity, but lacks experimental control, making it difficult to replicate and assess reliability.",
