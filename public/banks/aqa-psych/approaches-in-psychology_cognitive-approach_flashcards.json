    {
      "question": "What is the cognitive approach in psychology?",
      "answer": "The cognitive approach focuses on internal mental processes like perception, memory, and problem-solving, emphasizing how they influence behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'schema' in the context of cognitive psychology.",
      "answer": "A schema is a cognitive framework that helps organize and interpret information in the brain, influencing perception and memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of computer models in the cognitive approach?",
      "answer": "Computer models compare the human mind to a computer, highlighting information processing involving input, storage, and retrieval.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bartlett (1932) find about memory?",
      "answer": "Bartlett found that memory is reconstructive and influenced by cultural schemas, leading to distortions in recall over time.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are cognitive neuroscience's contributions to the cognitive approach?",
      "answer": "Cognitive neuroscience links cognitive processes to brain activity, using techniques like fMRI and PET scans to study brain functions.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'cognitive bias'.",
      "answer": "Cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that affects decisions and judgments, often due to reliance on mental shortcuts.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Loftus and Palmer (1974) study about memory?",
      "answer": "Loftus and Palmer studied the impact of leading questions on eyewitness testimony, finding that wording can alter memory recall.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the information processing model?",
      "answer": "The information processing model compares human thought processes to a computer, involving stages like encoding, storage, and retrieval.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'cognitive restructuring'.",
      "answer": "Cognitive restructuring involves identifying and challenging negative thought patterns to change maladaptive behaviors and emotions.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Miller (1956) propose about memory capacity?",
      "answer": "Miller proposed that the capacity of short-term memory is about 7±2 items, highlighting the limitations of information retention.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a 'mental representation'?",
      "answer": "A mental representation is an internal image or description that stands for an external reality, used in thought processes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'cognitive behavioral therapy' (CBT).",
      "answer": "CBT is a therapeutic approach combining cognitive and behavioral techniques to change negative thought patterns and behaviors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of schema apply to eyewitness testimony?",
      "answer": "Schemas can fill in gaps in memory, leading eyewitnesses to recall events inaccurately based on preexisting knowledge or stereotypes.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the information processing model to learning a new language.",
      "answer": "Learning a language involves encoding (listening/reading), storing (practicing/revising), and retrieving (speaking/writing) new vocabulary and grammar rules.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does cognitive bias affect decision-making in high-pressure situations?",
      "answer": "Under pressure, cognitive biases like confirmation bias may lead individuals to favor information supporting pre-existing beliefs, impairing objective decision-making.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the cognitive approach to understanding depression.",
      "answer": "Depression may be understood through negative schemas and cognitive distortions, leading to dysfunctional thinking patterns that CBT aims to alter.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the cognitive approach.",
      "answer": "A strength is its scientific basis, using controlled experiments and objective measures, making findings reliable and replicable.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the cognitive approach.",
      "answer": "A limitation is its reductionism, as it oversimplifies complex human behaviors by focusing solely on mental processes, ignoring emotions and social factors.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Loftus and Palmer (1974).",
      "answer": "While highly controlled, the study lacks ecological validity as artificial laboratory settings may not reflect real-world memory recall.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the contribution of cognitive neuroscience to psychology.",
      "answer": "Cognitive neuroscience has advanced understanding of mental processes by linking them to brain activity but relies heavily on imaging techniques, which can be costly and complex.",
      "ao": "AO3"
