    {
      "question": "What is localisation of function in the brain?",
      "answer": "Localisation of function is the theory that specific areas of the brain are responsible for different behaviors, processes, or activities.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'motor cortex'.",
      "answer": "The motor cortex is a region of the frontal lobe responsible for the planning, control, and execution of voluntary movements.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of Broca's area?",
      "answer": "Broca's area, located in the frontal lobe, is responsible for speech production and language processing.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Where is Wernicke's area located and what is its function?",
      "answer": "Wernicke's area is located in the left temporal lobe and is responsible for language comprehension.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Broca (1861) find about brain localisation?",
      "answer": "Broca (1861) identified that damage to a specific area of the frontal lobe impairs speech production, leading to Broca's aphasia.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Wernicke (1874) discover regarding language comprehension?",
      "answer": "Wernicke (1874) found that damage to a specific area in the left temporal lobe causes difficulties in understanding language, known as Wernicke's aphasia.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'somatosensory cortex'.",
      "answer": "The somatosensory cortex is a region in the parietal lobe that processes sensory information from the skin, such as touch, temperature, and pain.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of the auditory cortex?",
      "answer": "The auditory cortex, located in the temporal lobe, processes auditory information and is responsible for hearing.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Penfield (1950) contribute to localisation theory?",
      "answer": "Penfield (1950) used electrical stimulation of the brain to map cortical areas, supporting the localisation of function in different brain regions.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Identify the role of the visual cortex.",
      "answer": "The visual cortex, located in the occipital lobe, is responsible for processing visual information from the eyes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is lateralisation of function?",
      "answer": "Lateralisation refers to the dominance of one hemisphere of the brain in controlling specific functions, such as language being lateralised to the left hemisphere.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Sperry (1968) find in split-brain research?",
      "answer": "Sperry (1968) showed that split-brain patients had independent functioning hemispheres, supporting lateralisation and localisation of function.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does localisation of function apply to stroke recovery?",
      "answer": "Localisation suggests that damage to specific areas, like Broca's area, can impair functions such as speech. Rehabilitation focuses on retraining or compensating for lost functions.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply localisation theory to this scenario: A patient can't understand spoken language.",
      "answer": "Damage to Wernicke's area in the left temporal lobe likely causes the patient's inability to comprehend spoken language, as it processes language comprehension.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does localisation of function explain why some brain surgeries affect speech?",
      "answer": "Localisation theory suggests that surgeries impacting Broca's area can disrupt speech production, as this region is responsible for generating spoken language.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply lateralisation theory to a scenario where a patient can speak but not write.",
      "answer": "Lateralisation suggests separate hemispheric control; the left hemisphere may manage speech, while writing could involve right hemisphere functions, indicating specific area damage.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of localisation of function theory.",
      "answer": "A strength is the supporting evidence from brain scans showing specific areas activating during particular tasks, demonstrating functional specialisation.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of localisation of function theory.",
      "answer": "A limitation is plasticity; the brain can reorganise itself and transfer functions to undamaged areas, challenging strict localisation.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Sperry's (1968) split-brain research.",
      "answer": "Sperry's research used a small sample of patients with unique conditions, limiting generalisability. However, it provided controlled experimental evidence for lateralisation.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Penfield's (1950) cortical mapping.",
      "answer": "Penfield's use of direct brain stimulation was groundbreaking but involved invasive procedures, posing ethical concerns and affecting generalisability to non-clinical populations.",
      "ao": "AO3"
