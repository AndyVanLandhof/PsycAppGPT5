    {
      "question": "What is the endocrine system?",
      "answer": "A network of glands that secrete hormones to regulate bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, and mood.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define hormones.",
      "answer": "Chemical messengers released by glands into the bloodstream to target organs and tissues.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of the pituitary gland?",
      "answer": "Known as the 'master gland,' it releases hormones that regulate other glands in the endocrine system.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Selye (1936) find about stress and the endocrine system?",
      "answer": "Selye found that stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to cortisol release.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'adrenaline'.",
      "answer": "A hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, crucial in the fight or flight response by increasing heart rate and energy availability.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the thyroid gland?",
      "answer": "The thyroid gland regulates metabolism by releasing hormones such as thyroxine.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the pineal gland responsible for?",
      "answer": "The pineal gland secretes melatonin, which regulates sleep-wake cycles.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Taylor et al. (2000) find about gender differences in stress responses?",
      "answer": "Taylor et al. found that females are more likely to exhibit a 'tend and befriend' response due to oxytocin.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'negative feedback' in the endocrine system.",
      "answer": "A self-regulating mechanism where hormone release is reduced when levels return to normal.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of insulin in the body?",
      "answer": "Insulin, produced by the pancreas, regulates blood glucose levels by facilitating cellular glucose uptake.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Cannon (1932) contribute to understanding stress?",
      "answer": "Cannon coined 'fight or flight response,' highlighting adrenaline's role in immediate stress reactions.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the hypothalamus's role in the endocrine system?",
      "answer": "The hypothalamus links the nervous system to the endocrine system, controlling the pituitary gland.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does adrenaline apply to emergency situations?",
      "answer": "Adrenaline increases heart rate and energy, enabling individuals to respond quickly to threats.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of negative feedback to thyroid hormone regulation.",
      "answer": "Increased thyroxine inhibits TSH release from the pituitary, reducing thyroid activity and maintaining balance.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does cortisol apply to chronic stress scenarios?",
      "answer": "Prolonged stress causes continuous cortisol release, affecting immune function and increasing health risks.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the role of insulin to a person with diabetes.",
      "answer": "In diabetes, insulin dysfunction leads to poor glucose regulation, requiring external insulin or lifestyle changes.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the endocrine system's response to stress.",
      "answer": "The endocrine system's stress response is adaptive, preparing the body for immediate action and survival.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of using animal studies in endocrine research.",
      "answer": "Animal studies may lack generalizability due to physiological differences between animals and humans.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Selye's (1936) research on stress.",
      "answer": "Selye's research was pioneering but criticized for lack of specificity and over-reliance on animal models.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of using hormone assays in research.",
      "answer": "Hormone assays provide objective, quantifiable data, enhancing reliability and validity of findings.",
