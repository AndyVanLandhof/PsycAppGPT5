    {
      "question": "What is the endocrine system?",
      "answer": "The endocrine system is a network of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream to regulate bodily functions.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'hormone'.",
      "answer": "Hormones are chemical messengers secreted by endocrine glands that travel through the bloodstream to target organs.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the pituitary gland?",
      "answer": "The pituitary gland, often called the 'master gland', controls other endocrine glands and regulates growth, metabolism, and reproductive processes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'adrenaline' and its function.",
      "answer": "Adrenaline is a hormone released by the adrenal glands that prepares the body for 'fight or flight' by increasing heart rate and energy availability.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Selye (1936) find about stress response?",
      "answer": "Selye (1936) found that stress triggers a general adaptation syndrome, involving alarm, resistance, and exhaustion stages mediated by hormonal changes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of cortisol?",
      "answer": "Cortisol, a hormone released by the adrenal cortex, helps regulate metabolism, reduce inflammation, and assist with memory formulation.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'negative feedback' in the endocrine system.",
      "answer": "Negative feedback is a mechanism where increased output of a hormone inhibits its further release, maintaining homeostasis.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of insulin?",
      "answer": "Insulin, produced by the pancreas, regulates blood glucose levels by facilitating cellular glucose uptake.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Taylor et al. (2000) propose about stress response?",
      "answer": "Taylor et al. (2000) proposed the 'tend and befriend' response, suggesting females may respond to stress with nurturing activities and forming alliances.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the thyroid gland?",
      "answer": "The thyroid gland produces hormones like thyroxine that regulate metabolism, energy levels, and growth.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'oxytocin' and its primary functions.",
      "answer": "Oxytocin is a hormone involved in childbirth, lactation, and social bonding, often called the 'love hormone'.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of the hypothalamus in the endocrine system?",
      "answer": "The hypothalamus links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland, regulating body temperature, hunger, and circadian rhythms.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the fight or flight response apply to sudden danger?",
      "answer": "In sudden danger, adrenaline is released, increasing heart rate and energy, preparing the body to either confront or flee the threat.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of 'negative feedback' to blood sugar regulation.",
      "answer": "When blood sugar rises, insulin is secreted to lower it. Once normal, insulin secretion reduces, demonstrating negative feedback.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does oxytocin apply to social bonding scenarios?",
      "answer": "In social bonding, oxytocin enhances trust and emotional connections, promoting group cohesion and cooperation.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply cortisol function to stress management during exams.",
      "answer": "Cortisol increases glucose availability for heightened awareness and energy during exams, but prolonged elevation can impair concentration.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of using hormones to understand behavior.",
      "answer": "Hormonal studies provide a biological basis for behaviors, offering objective, measurable data that enhance understanding of physiological processes.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the endocrine system research.",
      "answer": "Endocrine research often lacks ecological validity as lab conditions may not reflect real-world hormonal responses and interactions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Selye's (1936) research.",
      "answer": "Selye's research used animal models, which may not fully generalize to humans, though it provided foundational insights into stress physiology.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the 'tend and befriend' theory by Taylor et al. (2000).",
      "answer": "The theory highlights gender differences in stress response, supported by evolutionary context, but may oversimplify complex hormonal interactions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
