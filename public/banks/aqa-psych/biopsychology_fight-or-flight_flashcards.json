    {
      "question": "What is the fight or flight response?",
      "answer": "The fight or flight response is an automatic physiological reaction to a perceived threat, preparing the body to either confront or flee the threat.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the role of adrenaline in the fight or flight response.",
      "answer": "Adrenaline is a hormone released from the adrenal glands, increasing heart rate, blood flow, and energy, preparing the body for rapid physical action.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Cannon (1932) propose about the fight or flight response?",
      "answer": "Cannon (1932) proposed that the fight or flight response is a fundamental physiological reaction to threat, essential for survival.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'sympathetic nervous system' in the context of the fight or flight response.",
      "answer": "The sympathetic nervous system activates the fight or flight response, increasing heart rate, dilating pupils, and redirecting blood flow to muscles.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the hypothalamus play in the fight or flight response?",
      "answer": "The hypothalamus activates the adrenal medulla, triggering the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the fight or flight response.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of cortisol in stress responses?",
      "answer": "Cortisol, released from the adrenal cortex, increases glucose availability, curbing non-essential functions to manage stress in prolonged responses.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'parasympathetic nervous system' and its role post-threat.",
      "answer": "The parasympathetic nervous system counteracts the fight or flight response, restoring body functions to a resting state post-threat.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Selye (1956) propose about stress responses?",
      "answer": "Selye (1956) proposed the General Adaptation Syndrome, describing stress responses in three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'acute stress response' with an example.",
      "answer": "An acute stress response is a short-term reaction to an immediate threat, like increased heart rate when narrowly avoiding a car accident.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Taylor et al. (2000) suggest about gender differences in stress responses?",
      "answer": "Taylor et al. (2000) suggested females may exhibit a 'tend and befriend' response, focusing on social alliances rather than fight or flight.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'chronic stress' and its potential impact.",
      "answer": "Chronic stress is long-term stress, potentially leading to health issues like hypertension due to prolonged exposure to stress hormones.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Gray (1988) propose about the freeze response?",
      "answer": "Gray (1988) proposed the freeze response as a primary reaction to threat, allowing for assessment before fight or flight.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the fight or flight response to this scenario: A student hears a sudden loud noise while studying.",
      "answer": "The student experiences increased heart rate and alertness as adrenaline is released, preparing them to assess and react to potential danger.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of 'tend and befriend' apply to a mother protecting her children in a crisis?",
      "answer": "The mother forms social alliances and provides care, aligning with 'tend and befriend' rather than engaging in fight or flight.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the role of cortisol in a scenario where someone experiences a demanding work week.",
      "answer": "Cortisol levels increase to maintain energy and focus during the demanding week, but prolonged elevation may lead to fatigue.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the parasympathetic nervous system apply after running from a perceived threat?",
      "answer": "After the threat, the parasympathetic nervous system reduces heart rate and breathing, restoring the body to a calm state.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the fight or flight response theory.",
      "answer": "A strength is its evolutionary basis, providing a survival mechanism essential for responding to immediate physical threats.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the fight or flight response theory.",
      "answer": "A limitation is its lack of consideration for gender differences, as it primarily reflects male responses, ignoring 'tend and befriend'.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology used in Cannon's (1932) research on fight or flight.",
      "answer": "Cannon's research, based on animal studies, may lack generalizability to humans due to physiological and psychological differences.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology used in Taylor et al. (2000) on stress responses.",
      "answer": "Taylor et al.'s use of meta-analysis provides comprehensive insights but may be limited by the quality and homogeneity of included studies.",
      "ao": "AO3"
