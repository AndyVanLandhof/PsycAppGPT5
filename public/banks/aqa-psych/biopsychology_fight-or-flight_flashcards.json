    {
      "question": "What is the fight or flight response?",
      "answer": "The fight or flight response is an automatic physiological reaction to a perceived threat, preparing the body to either confront or flee from the threat.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the fight or flight response.",
      "answer": "The sympathetic nervous system activates the body's arousal to a threat, increasing heart rate, dilating pupils, and redirecting blood flow to essential muscles.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does adrenaline play in the fight or flight response?",
      "answer": "Adrenaline, released from the adrenal medulla, increases heart rate, blood pressure, and energy supplies, preparing the body to respond to a threat.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the role of the parasympathetic nervous system following the fight or flight response.",
      "answer": "The parasympathetic nervous system counteracts the fight or flight response, calming the body by decreasing heart rate and facilitating digestion.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Cannon (1932) find about the fight or flight response?",
      "answer": "Cannon (1932) identified the fight or flight response as a key physiological reaction to stress, involving the sympathetic nervous system and adrenaline release.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Selye (1936) contribute to stress research?",
      "answer": "Selye (1936) proposed the General Adaptation Syndrome, suggesting that stress responses occur in three stages: alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define cortisol's role in the stress response.",
      "answer": "Cortisol, released from the adrenal cortex, aids in managing stress by increasing glucose availability, suppressing the immune system, and regulating metabolism.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Taylor et al. (2000) suggest about gender differences in stress responses?",
      "answer": "Taylor et al. (2000) proposed that females may exhibit a 'tend and befriend' response to stress, prioritizing social bonding and caregiving over fight or flight.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the hypothalamus in the fight or flight response?",
      "answer": "The hypothalamus activates the sympathetic nervous system and signals the adrenal medulla to release adrenaline, initiating the fight or flight response.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Gray (1988) suggest about the fight or flight response?",
      "answer": "Gray (1988) suggested that an initial 'freeze' response may occur before fight or flight, allowing individuals to assess the best course of action.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the SAM system in stress response.",
      "answer": "The SAM (Sympathomedullary Pathway) system involves the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla, facilitating immediate fight or flight responses.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the HPA axis in the context of stress?",
      "answer": "The HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal) axis regulates long-term stress responses, releasing cortisol to manage prolonged stress.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the fight or flight response to this scenario: A student hears a fire alarm during an exam.",
      "answer": "The student's sympathetic nervous system activates, increasing heart rate and adrenaline release, preparing them to evacuate.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the fight or flight response apply to a person encountering a wild animal?",
      "answer": "The person experiences increased heart rate and adrenaline, enabling rapid decision-making to either confront or escape the animal.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the fight or flight response to this scenario: A driver narrowly avoids a collision.",
      "answer": "The driver's sympathetic nervous system triggers adrenaline release, heightening alertness and reflexes to avoid the crash.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the fight or flight response apply to someone preparing for a job interview?",
      "answer": "The anticipation of the interview may trigger mild fight or flight responses, such as increased heart rate and alertness, aiding performance.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the fight or flight response model.",
      "answer": "The fight or flight model is supported by extensive empirical research, providing a clear biological basis for stress responses.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the fight or flight response.",
      "answer": "The fight or flight model may oversimplify stress responses by not fully accounting for individual differences and gender variations.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Cannon's (1932) research on the fight or flight response.",
      "answer": "Cannon's research utilized animal studies, which may limit generalizability to humans due to species differences in stress responses.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Taylor et al. (2000) regarding stress responses.",
      "answer": "Taylor et al.'s research highlighted gender differences using meta-analysis, providing robust evidence but potentially overlooking cultural variations.",
      "ao": "AO3"
