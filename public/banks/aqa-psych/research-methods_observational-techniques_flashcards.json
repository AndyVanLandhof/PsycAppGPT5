    {
      "question": "What is a naturalistic observation?",
      "answer": "A research method where behavior is observed in its natural environment without manipulation or interference by the researcher.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define participant observation.",
      "answer": "A research technique where the observer becomes part of the group being studied to gain a deeper insight into their behaviors and motives.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is inter-observer reliability?",
      "answer": "The degree to which different observers give consistent estimates or descriptions of the same observed behaviors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Festinger et al. (1956) find about participant observation?",
      "answer": "Festinger et al. used participant observation to infiltrate a cult, finding that members maintained beliefs even when prophecies failed, highlighting cognitive dissonance.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define overt observation.",
      "answer": "A type of observation where participants are aware they are being observed, which may influence their behavior due to the observer effect.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a covert observation?",
      "answer": "An observation method where participants are unaware they are being observed, reducing the risk of observer effect and demand characteristics.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Rosenhan (1973) find about observational techniques?",
      "answer": "Rosenhan's study showed that psychiatric staff failed to distinguish between sane and insane, highlighting issues of reliability and validity in clinical observations.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define structured observation.",
      "answer": "An observation method where researchers use predefined categories of behavior to systematically record observed behaviors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is unstructured observation?",
      "answer": "An observation method without predefined categories, allowing researchers to record all relevant behaviors as they occur.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is observer bias?",
      "answer": "A bias in observation where the researcher’s expectations influence their interpretation of the observed behaviors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Ainsworth (1970) find about observational techniques?",
      "answer": "In the 'Strange Situation,' Ainsworth identified different attachment styles using controlled observational methods, contributing to attachment theory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define event sampling.",
      "answer": "An observational technique where the observer records occurrences of specific behaviors of interest every time they occur during a study period.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply covert observation to this scenario: A researcher wants to study shoplifting behavior.",
      "answer": "The researcher could pose as a shopper in stores, observing individuals’ behaviors without them knowing they are being watched to reduce observer effect.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does inter-observer reliability apply to structured observation?",
      "answer": "By using clear behavior categories, multiple observers can compare their recordings to ensure consistency and reliability in structured observation.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply event sampling to this scenario: A study on aggression in playgrounds.",
      "answer": "Observers could record each instance of aggressive behavior, such as hitting or shouting, during a set observation period in the playground.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does observer bias apply to overt observation?",
      "answer": "In overt observation, the researcher's expectations might influence how they record behaviors, especially if participants change behavior knowing they are observed.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of naturalistic observation.",
      "answer": "It provides high ecological validity as behaviors are observed in their natural settings, reflecting real-world interactions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of participant observation.",
      "answer": "It poses ethical issues, as participants may be unaware of the researcher's true identity, potentially violating informed consent.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Rosenhan's (1973) study.",
      "answer": "Rosenhan’s study lacked control and standardization, reducing reliability. However, it effectively highlighted flaws in psychiatric diagnosis.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the use of structured observation.",
      "answer": "Structured observation allows for replicability and reliability but may miss spontaneous behaviors not predefined in categories.",
      "ao": "AO3"
