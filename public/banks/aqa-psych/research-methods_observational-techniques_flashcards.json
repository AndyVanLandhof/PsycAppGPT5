    {
      "question": "What is naturalistic observation?",
      "answer": "Naturalistic observation involves observing subjects in their natural environment without interference.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define participant observation.",
      "answer": "Participant observation is when the researcher becomes actively involved in the group being studied.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is structured observation?",
      "answer": "Structured observation uses a predetermined framework or coding scheme to record behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define covert observation.",
      "answer": "Covert observation is where the subjects are unaware they are being observed.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Festinger et al. (1956) find about cognitive dissonance using observational techniques?",
      "answer": "Festinger et al. found that people often change their beliefs to reduce dissonance, using covert observation in a cult.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is overt observation?",
      "answer": "In overt observation, participants know they are being observed, which may influence their behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define time sampling.",
      "answer": "Time sampling involves recording behaviors at specific intervals, providing a representative sample over time.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is event sampling?",
      "answer": "Event sampling involves recording each occurrence of a specific behavior during the observation period.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bandura et al. (1961) find using observational methods?",
      "answer": "Bandura et al. found children imitate aggressive behavior observed in adults, using structured observation with the Bobo doll experiment.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define inter-observer reliability.",
      "answer": "Inter-observer reliability is the degree to which different observers agree on their observations.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Hawthorne effect?",
      "answer": "The Hawthorne effect is when participants alter their behavior due to awareness of being observed.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define non-participant observation.",
      "answer": "Non-participant observation is when the researcher observes without becoming involved in the group or activity.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply structured observation to this scenario: A teacher wants to study student interactions during group work.",
      "answer": "The teacher can use a coding scheme to systematically record specific behaviors, such as turn-taking and interruptions, to analyze interaction patterns.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does covert observation apply to studying gang behavior?",
      "answer": "Researchers can covertly observe gang members to gain insights without influencing their natural behavior through awareness of being observed.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply participant observation to this scenario: A researcher wants to understand the daily routines of a remote tribe.",
      "answer": "The researcher can live with the tribe, participating in their activities to gain an insider perspective and detailed understanding of their routines.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Hawthorne effect apply to a study on workplace productivity?",
      "answer": "Workers aware of being observed may increase productivity, not due to changes in conditions, but due to the observation itself.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of naturalistic observation.",
      "answer": "Naturalistic observation provides high ecological validity as behaviors are observed in their natural settings, reflecting real-life scenarios.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of participant observation.",
      "answer": "Participant observation may introduce researcher bias, as the observer may influence or become subjective in interpreting behaviors.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Bandura et al.'s (1961) study.",
      "answer": "Bandura et al. used structured observation to control variables, but the artificial setting may have reduced ecological validity.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of using coding schemes in structured observation.",
      "answer": "Coding schemes enhance reliability by providing standardized categories, allowing consistent and replicable data collection.",
      "ao": "AO3"
