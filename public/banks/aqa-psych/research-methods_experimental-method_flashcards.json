    {
      "question": "What is an independent variable?",
      "answer": "The variable that is manipulated by the researcher in an experiment to observe its effect on the dependent variable.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define dependent variable.",
      "answer": "The variable that is measured in an experiment to see if it is affected by changes in the independent variable.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a laboratory experiment?",
      "answer": "An experiment conducted in a controlled environment where the researcher manipulates the independent variable and controls extraneous variables.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bandura et al. (1961) find about aggression?",
      "answer": "Bandura et al. found that children exposed to an aggressive model were more likely to imitate aggressive behavior than those not exposed.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define random allocation.",
      "answer": "Random allocation is a technique used to assign participants to different groups in an experiment, ensuring each participant has an equal chance of being placed in any group.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a field experiment?",
      "answer": "An experiment conducted in a natural setting where the independent variable is manipulated by the researcher, but extraneous variables are less controlled.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define double-blind procedure.",
      "answer": "A procedure where neither the participants nor the experimenters know who is receiving a particular treatment, reducing bias.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Loftus and Palmer (1974) find about eyewitness testimony?",
      "answer": "Loftus and Palmer found that the wording of questions could alter participants' recall of car speeds, demonstrating the unreliability of eyewitness testimony.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is operationalization?",
      "answer": "Operationalization is the process of defining variables in practical, measurable terms to ensure they can be empirically tested.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define ecological validity.",
      "answer": "Ecological validity refers to the extent to which the findings of a study can be generalized to real-life settings.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Milgram (1963) find about obedience?",
      "answer": "Milgram found that a high proportion of participants were willing to obey authority figures, even when instructed to perform actions conflicting with their personal conscience.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define demand characteristics.",
      "answer": "Demand characteristics are cues in an experiment that might inform participants about the study's purpose, potentially influencing their behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does random allocation apply to this scenario: researchers want to test a new teaching method?",
      "answer": "Researchers should randomly allocate students to either the new teaching method or a standard method group to ensure differences in outcomes are due to the method itself.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply double-blind procedure to this scenario: testing a new drug's effectiveness.",
      "answer": "In testing a new drug, neither the participants nor the administering researchers should know who receives the drug or placebo to prevent bias in results.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does operationalization apply to this scenario: studying stress levels?",
      "answer": "To study stress levels, researchers must define stress in measurable terms, such as cortisol levels or a standardized questionnaire score.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply field experiment to this scenario: measuring customer satisfaction in a cafe.",
      "answer": "Researchers could alter a variable, like music volume, in the cafe and measure customer satisfaction through surveys, observing real-time reactions.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of laboratory experiments.",
      "answer": "Laboratory experiments allow researchers to control extraneous variables, ensuring the independent variable is the cause of any observed effect.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of field experiments.",
      "answer": "Field experiments often have less control over extraneous variables, which may confound results and reduce internal validity.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Bandura et al. (1961).",
      "answer": "Bandura's study allowed for the control of variables and standardization, but its artificial setting may have reduced ecological validity.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate Milgram's (1963) study in terms of ecological validity.",
      "answer": "Milgram's study had low ecological validity as the laboratory setting and artificial task of administering shocks do not reflect real-world obedience scenarios.",
      "ao": "AO3"
