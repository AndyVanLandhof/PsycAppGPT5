    {
      "question": "What did Ainsworth et al. (1978) find about attachment types?",
      "answer": "Ainsworth et al. (1978) found that 66% of infants were securely attached, 22% were insecure-avoidant, and 12% were insecure-resistant, based on the Strange Situation results.",

      "question": "What did Van IJzendoorn & Kroonenberg (1988) find?",

      "question": "Apply insecure-avoidant attachment to this scenario: A child in a daycare ignores their parent upon pick-up.",

      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does insecure-resistant attachment manifest in a child at a playground?",
      "answer": "A child with insecure-resistant attachment may stay close to the caregiver, showing reluctance to explore and distress when the caregiver moves away.",
