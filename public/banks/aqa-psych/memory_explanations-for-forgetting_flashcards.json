    {
      "question": "What is retrieval failure?",
      "answer": "Retrieval failure occurs when information is stored in memory but cannot be accessed due to lack of retrieval cues.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define proactive interference.",
      "answer": "Proactive interference is when older memories disrupt the recall of newer memories.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define retroactive interference.",
      "answer": "Retroactive interference occurs when newer memories disrupt the recall of older memories.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Tulving and Pearlstone (1966) find about retrieval cues?",
      "answer": "Tulving and Pearlstone found that participants recalled more words when given category cues, demonstrating the importance of retrieval cues in memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Godden and Baddeley (1975) find about context-dependent forgetting?",
      "answer": "They found that divers recalled words better in the same context (land or water) where they learned them, supporting context-dependent memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is state-dependent forgetting?",
      "answer": "State-dependent forgetting occurs when recall is easier in the same physical or emotional state as when the memory was encoded.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Carter and Cassaday (1998) find about state-dependent forgetting?",
      "answer": "Carter and Cassaday found that participants recalled information better when their internal state at recall matched their state during learning (e.g., on or off antihistamines).",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the encoding specificity principle?",
      "answer": "The encoding specificity principle, proposed by Tulving, states that memory is most effective when information present at encoding is also available at retrieval.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'cue' in the context of memory.",
      "answer": "A cue is a stimulus that aids retrieval of information from long-term memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon?",
      "answer": "The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon is a state where one cannot quite recall a familiar word or name but feels close to remembering it.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did McGeoch and McDonald (1931) study about interference?",
      "answer": "They studied how similarity of material affects interference, finding that more similar information increases the likelihood of interference.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is decay theory?",
      "answer": "Decay theory suggests that memories fade over time if they are not accessed or used.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does proactive interference apply to studying for multiple subjects?",
      "answer": "Proactive interference might cause confusion in recalling new material for a subject if previously studied subjects have similar content.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the encoding specificity principle to a student preparing for exams.",
      "answer": "A student should try to study in environments similar to their exam environment to enhance recall, as similar cues will aid retrieval.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does context-dependent forgetting apply to eyewitness testimony?",
      "answer": "Eyewitnesses might recall events more accurately if they revisit the crime scene, as environmental cues can trigger memory retrieval.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply state-dependent forgetting to a person who drinks coffee while studying.",
      "answer": "A person who drinks coffee while studying may recall information better if they consume coffee before the exam due to state-dependent memory.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of retrieval failure as an explanation for forgetting.",
      "answer": "Retrieval failure is supported by substantial empirical evidence, such as Tulving and Pearlstone's study, which emphasizes the role of cues in memory recall.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of interference theory.",
      "answer": "Interference theory may not fully explain forgetting in real-world settings as it often relies on artificial lab-based tasks and lacks ecological validity.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Godden and Baddeley (1975).",
      "answer": "The study has high ecological validity due to the naturalistic setting, but its generalizability is limited as divers are not representative of the general population.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Carter and Cassaday (1998).",
      "answer": "The study provides strong evidence for state-dependent forgetting, but the use of antihistamines limits generalizability due to potential side effects affecting participants differently.",
      "ao": "AO3"
