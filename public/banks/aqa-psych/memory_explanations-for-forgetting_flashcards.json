    {
      "question": "What is proactive interference?",
      "answer": "Proactive interference occurs when older memories interfere with the retrieval of newer memories.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is retroactive interference?",
      "answer": "Retroactive interference occurs when new memories disrupt the retrieval of older memories.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define retrieval failure.",
      "answer": "Retrieval failure is the inability to access a memory due to the absence of cues present at encoding.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Tulving and Pearlstone (1966) find about retrieval cues?",
      "answer": "They found that participants recalled more words when given category names as cues compared to free recall.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the encoding specificity principle?",
      "answer": "The encoding specificity principle states that memory is improved when information available at encoding is also present at retrieval.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Godden and Baddeley (1975) discover about context-dependent forgetting?",
      "answer": "Memory recall was better when the learning and recall environments matched, such as learning and recalling underwater.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Carter and Cassaday (1998) find about state-dependent forgetting?",
      "answer": "Memory recall was better when participants' physiological states at learning and recall matched, such as being sober or on antihistamines.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define context-dependent forgetting.",
      "answer": "Context-dependent forgetting occurs when environmental cues present at encoding are absent during recall.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define state-dependent forgetting.",
      "answer": "State-dependent forgetting occurs when the internal state at encoding differs from the state during recall.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a retrieval cue?",
      "answer": "A retrieval cue is a trigger or hint that helps access information stored in memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Baddeley and Hitch (1977) find about interference?",
      "answer": "Rugby players who played fewer matches had better recall of team names, suggesting interference affects memory retrieval.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define interference theory.",
      "answer": "Interference theory suggests that forgetting occurs because memories interfere with each other, especially if similar.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does interference apply to forgetting a new phone number?",
      "answer": "Proactive interference may occur if your old phone number disrupts your ability to remember the new one.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the encoding specificity principle to revising for exams.",
      "answer": "Revising in a quiet room similar to the exam setting may enhance recall due to contextual cue similarity.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How might state-dependent forgetting affect performance in a public speaking scenario?",
      "answer": "If you practiced while relaxed but feel anxious during the speech, the mismatch can hinder recall.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply context-dependent forgetting to losing keys after moving house.",
      "answer": "If you placed keys in a specific spot before moving and fail to remember this in a new home, it's context-dependent forgetting.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of research into retrieval failure.",
      "answer": "It has practical applications in improving recall, such as using context reinstatement techniques in eyewitness testimony.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of interference theory.",
      "answer": "Interference theory is often criticized for its lack of ecological validity due to reliance on artificial lab tasks.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Godden and Baddeley (1975).",
      "answer": "The study's ecological validity is high due to realistic settings, but the sample of divers limits generalizability.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Tulving and Pearlstone (1966).",
      "answer": "The study has high internal validity due to controlled lab conditions, but lacks ecological validity due to artificial tasks.",
      "ao": "AO3"
