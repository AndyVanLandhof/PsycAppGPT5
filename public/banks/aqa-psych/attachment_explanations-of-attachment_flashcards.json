    {
      "question": "What is attachment?",
      "answer": "Attachment is a strong, emotional bond between an infant and their primary caregiver, providing security and comfort.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'secure base' in attachment theory.",
      "answer": "A secure base is the caregiver's presence that provides an infant with a sense of safety, allowing exploration.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bowlby (1958) propose about attachment?",
      "answer": "Bowlby proposed that attachment is an innate system in humans evolved to keep infants close to their caregivers for survival.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'monotropy' according to Bowlby.",
      "answer": "Monotropy is Bowlby's concept that infants form a primary attachment to one caregiver, which is central to their development.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'critical period' in attachment theory?",
      "answer": "The critical period is a specific time frame (0-2.5 years) in which an attachment must form, or it may not develop properly.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'internal working model' in attachment theory.",
      "answer": "The internal working model is a cognitive framework comprising mental representations for understanding the world, self, and others.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Ainsworth (1978) find about attachment types?",
      "answer": "Ainsworth identified three attachment types: secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-resistant based on the Strange Situation procedure.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'continuity hypothesis'?",
      "answer": "The continuity hypothesis suggests that early attachment types are reflected in adult relationships and social/emotional development.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Harlow (1958) find about attachment in monkeys?",
      "answer": "Harlow found that infant monkeys preferred comfort from a cloth 'mother' over a wire 'mother' that provided food, suggesting comfort is crucial for attachment.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'reciprocity' in caregiver-infant interactions.",
      "answer": "Reciprocity involves mutual, rhythmic exchanges between caregiver and infant, fostering attachment through responsiveness and interaction.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Lorenz (1935) demonstrate about imprinting?",
      "answer": "Lorenz showed that geese form an attachment to the first moving object they see, demonstrating a critical period for imprinting.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Bowlby's 'maternal deprivation hypothesis'?",
      "answer": "Bowlby's hypothesis states that prolonged separation from the mother can lead to emotional and intellectual developmental issues.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of 'secure base' apply to a child starting school?",
      "answer": "A child using their primary caregiver as a secure base may explore their new school environment confidently, knowing they have support.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Bowlby's attachment theory to a child showing stranger anxiety.",
      "answer": "Stranger anxiety in a child is explained by Bowlby's theory as a protective mechanism to maintain proximity to the caregiver.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the internal working model be applied to a teenager's friendships?",
      "answer": "A teenager with a positive internal working model may form secure and trusting friendships, reflecting their early attachment experiences.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Ainsworth's attachment types to a scenario where a child is distressed when separated from the parent.",
      "answer": "If a child is distressed upon separation but comforted upon reunion, they likely have a secure attachment, as per Ainsworth's types.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of Bowlby's attachment theory.",
      "answer": "Bowlby's theory is supported by the concept of the critical period, which aligns with biological evidence of sensitive developmental periods.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of Harlow's (1958) study on monkeys.",
      "answer": "Harlow's study faced ethical criticism due to the severe emotional distress caused to the monkeys, questioning the morality of the methods.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Ainsworth's Strange Situation.",
      "answer": "The Strange Situation has high control and replicability but may lack ecological validity as it is conducted in an artificial environment.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of Lorenz's (1935) imprinting study.",
      "answer": "Lorenz's study on geese may not fully generalize to human attachment due to species differences in bonding and development.",
