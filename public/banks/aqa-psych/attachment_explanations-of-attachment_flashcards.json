      "question": "What did Ainsworth (1978) find in the Strange Situation?",
      "answer": "Ainsworth identified three main attachment types (secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-resistant) based on children's responses to separation and reunion with their caregiver.",

      "question": "What is the learning theory of attachment?",
      "answer": "The learning theory posits that attachment is formed through classical and operant conditioning, with food often serving as a primary reinforcer.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'insecure-avoidant attachment'.",
      "answer": "Insecure-avoidant attachment is marked by indifference on separation and avoidance on reunion with the caregiver, indicating a weak attachment bond.",

    {
      "question": "What did Schaffer and Emerson (1964) find about attachment?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Bowlby's theory apply to a child with separation anxiety?",
      "answer": "Bowlby's theory suggests separation anxiety results from an insecure attachment, where the child doubts the caregiver's availability and responsiveness.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of 'secure base' to a child exploring a playground.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How might the learning theory explain a child's attachment to a grandparent?",
      "answer": "Learning theory suggests the child associates the grandparent with positive reinforcement, such as receiving care, attention, or treats, thus forming an attachment.",
      "ao": "AO2"

    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of 'internal working model' to a teenager's friendships.",
      "answer": "A teenager's internal working model, shaped by early attachment, influences expectations and behaviors in friendships, such as trust and conflict resolution.",

    {
      "question": "Give one strength of Bowlby's attachment theory.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the learning theory of attachment.",
      "answer": "The learning theory is criticized for oversimplifying attachment, ignoring innate biological factors and the role of comfort and security in attachment formation.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Harlow's (1958) study.",
      "answer": "Harlow's study faced ethical criticisms due to the distress caused to monkeys, but it provided crucial insights into the importance of contact comfort in attachment.",

      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Ainsworth's (1978) Strange Situation.",
