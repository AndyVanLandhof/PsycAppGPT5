    {
      "question": "Apply functional recovery to this scenario: A patient regains speech after a stroke.",
      "answer": "The patient's brain has engaged in functional recovery, potentially through cortical remapping or the activation of secondary language areas.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does synaptic pruning apply to adolescent brain development?",
      "answer": "During adolescence, synaptic pruning eliminates weaker synaptic connections, enhancing the efficiency of neural networks involved in complex cognitive tasks.",
