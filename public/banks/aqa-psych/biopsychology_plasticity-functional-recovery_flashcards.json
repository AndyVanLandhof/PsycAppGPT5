    {
      "question": "What is brain plasticity?",
      "answer": "Brain plasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience, learning, or injury.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define functional recovery.",
      "answer": "Functional recovery is the brain's ability to redistribute or transfer functions from damaged areas to undamaged areas after trauma.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Maguire et al. (2000) find about taxi drivers' brains?",
      "answer": "Maguire et al. found that London taxi drivers had a larger posterior hippocampus, suggesting that spatial navigation experiences can lead to structural brain changes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Hubel and Wiesel (1963) discover in their study?",
      "answer": "Hubel and Wiesel found that sewing one eye shut in kittens led to changes in the brain's structure, demonstrating neural plasticity.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is synaptic pruning?",
      "answer": "Synaptic pruning is the process where weaker synaptic connections are eliminated and stronger connections are strengthened, enhancing brain efficiency.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define neural regeneration.",
      "answer": "Neural regeneration refers to the growth of new neurons and connections after brain injury or damage.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Draganski et al. (2006) find about juggling?",
      "answer": "Draganski et al. found that learning to juggle increased grey matter in brain areas involved in visual and motor activity, illustrating plasticity.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is cortical remapping?",
      "answer": "Cortical remapping is the process where brain functions are reorganized to different areas after damage.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Kempermann et al. (1998) find in enriched environments?",
      "answer": "Kempermann et al. found that rats in enriched environments developed more new neurons in the hippocampus than those in standard conditions.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define axonal sprouting.",
      "answer": "Axonal sprouting is the growth of new nerve endings that connect with other undamaged neurons to form new pathways after injury.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Elbert et al. (1995) find about musicians?",
      "answer": "Elbert et al. found that musicians had greater cortical representation for the fingers of their left hand, indicating motor plasticity.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Tajiri et al. (2013) find about stem cells in rodents?",
      "answer": "Tajiri et al. found that stem cell transplants in rats enhanced recovery after brain injury, showing potential for functional recovery.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does brain plasticity apply to stroke recovery?",
      "answer": "After a stroke, undamaged areas of the brain can adapt and compensate for damaged areas, aiding recovery through plasticity.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of plasticity to learning a new skill.",
      "answer": "Learning a new skill, like playing piano, can induce plastic changes in the brain's motor cortex, enhancing synaptic connections.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does functional recovery apply to traumatic brain injury?",
      "answer": "After a traumatic brain injury, functional recovery allows the brain to compensate by reorganizing functions to undamaged regions, aiding rehabilitation.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of synaptic pruning to adolescence.",
      "answer": "During adolescence, synaptic pruning occurs, where unnecessary neural connections are eliminated, refining brain structure for more efficient functioning.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of research into brain plasticity.",
      "answer": "Research into brain plasticity has practical applications, such as improving rehabilitation techniques for patients recovering from brain injuries.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of plasticity research.",
      "answer": "A limitation is that much plasticity research relies on animal studies, which may not fully generalize to humans due to species differences.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Maguire et al. (2000).",
      "answer": "Maguire et al. used MRI scans providing objective and reliable data, but the study's correlational nature means causation cannot be inferred.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodological approach of Hubel and Wiesel's study.",
      "answer": "Hubel and Wiesel's study was pioneering, showing plasticity, but ethical concerns arise due to the invasive procedures on animals.",
