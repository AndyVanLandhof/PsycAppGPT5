    {
      "question": "Define the 'weapon focus effect.'",
      "answer": "The weapon focus effect is the tendency for the presence of a weapon to draw attention and impair a witness's ability to remember other details of a crime.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of weapon focus to this scenario: A witness sees a robbery involving a gun.",

      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Loftus and Palmer (1974).",
