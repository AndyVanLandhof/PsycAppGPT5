      "question": "What is eyewitness testimony?",
      "answer": "Eyewitness testimony is a legal term describing the account a bystander or victim gives in the courtroom, detailing what they observed during a specific incident.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define leading questions in the context of eyewitness testimony.",
      "answer": "Leading questions are questions that suggest a particular answer or contain the information the examiner is looking to have confirmed.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Loftus and Palmer (1974) find about leading questions?",
      "answer": "Loftus and Palmer found that the wording of questions could influence participants' memory, specifically that verbs like 'smashed' led to higher speed estimates than 'contacted'.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the misinformation effect.",
      "answer": "The misinformation effect occurs when a person's recall of an event is altered by misleading information presented after the event.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the cognitive interview?",
      "answer": "The cognitive interview is a method of interviewing eyewitnesses to help them retrieve more accurate memories, involving techniques like context reinstatement and varied recall.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Gabbert et al. (2003) find about post-event discussion?",
      "answer": "Gabbert et al. found that 71% of participants who discussed the event with others mistakenly recalled information acquired during the discussion.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'anxiety' in the context of eyewitness testimony.",
      "answer": "Anxiety in eyewitness testimony refers to the emotional response elicited during or after witnessing a crime, which can affect the accuracy of memory recall.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Yuille and Cutshall (1986) find about anxiety and EWT?",
      "answer": "Yuille and Cutshall found that witnesses of a real-life shooting were accurate in their accounts even months later, suggesting anxiety can enhance memory recall.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'weapon focus' effect.",
      "answer": "The weapon focus effect is a phenomenon where a witness's attention is drawn to a weapon, impairing their ability to recall other details of the scene.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Christianson and Hubinette (1993) find about anxiety's effect on EWT?",
      "answer": "They found that witnesses to real bank robberies had good recall, especially those who experienced higher anxiety levels, suggesting anxiety can enhance eyewitness memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the reconstructive memory theory?",
      "answer": "Reconstructive memory theory suggests that memories are not exact copies but are reconstructed each time they are recalled, influenced by schemas and other cognitive processes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'schema' in the context of memory.",
      "answer": "A schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information, potentially influencing memory recall and reconstruction.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the cognitive interview apply to improving EWT accuracy?",
      "answer": "The cognitive interview uses techniques like context reinstatement and varied recall to enhance memory retrieval, reducing inaccuracies in eyewitness testimony.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the misinformation effect to this scenario: A witness reads a news report with incorrect details.",
      "answer": "The witness may incorporate incorrect details from the news report into their memory, demonstrating the misinformation effect's impact on eyewitness testimony.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does anxiety apply to this scenario: A witness feels intense fear during a robbery?",
      "answer": "Intense fear during the robbery could either enhance or impair the witness's memory of the event, depending on the complexity of the situation and individual differences.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the weapon focus effect to this scenario: A witness notices a knife during a crime.",
      "answer": "The witness's attention may be drawn to the knife, impairing their ability to recall other details, exemplifying the weapon focus effect.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the cognitive interview.",
      "answer": "The cognitive interview is supported by research showing it elicits more accurate information from witnesses than standard interviewing techniques.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of Loftus and Palmer's (1974) study.",
      "answer": "A limitation is its low ecological validity as it used artificial scenarios, which may not reflect real-life complexities of witnessing an event.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Gabbert et al. (2003).",
      "answer": "The study's strength is its controlled conditions, allowing for cause and effect. However, it lacks ecological validity due to its laboratory setting.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of using anxiety as a factor in EWT.",
      "answer": "Anxiety's effect on EWT is inconsistent; some studies show it enhances recall, while others show it impairs it, indicating other factors may be at play.",
