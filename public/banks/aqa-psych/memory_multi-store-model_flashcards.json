    {
      "question": "What is the multi-store model of memory?",
      "answer": "The multi-store model is a linear model proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) describing memory as composed of three stores: sensory register, short-term memory, and long-term memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define sensory register in the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "The sensory register is the first store in the multi-store model where sensory information is held briefly, allowing for initial processing before it is transferred to short-term memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Miller (1956) find about short-term memory?",
      "answer": "Miller (1956) discovered that short-term memory has a capacity of 7±2 items, suggesting it can hold between 5 and 9 pieces of information at a time.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is information transferred from short-term to long-term memory?",
      "answer": "Information is transferred from short-term to long-term memory through a process called rehearsal, which involves repeatedly practicing or reviewing the information.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define long-term memory according to the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "Long-term memory is the final store in the multi-store model, where information is held indefinitely with a potentially unlimited capacity and duration.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Peterson and Peterson (1959) find about the duration of short-term memory?",
      "answer": "Peterson and Peterson (1959) found that short-term memory has a brief duration of about 18-30 seconds without rehearsal.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of attention in the multi-store model?",
      "answer": "Attention is the process by which information in the sensory register is selectively focused on and transferred to short-term memory for further processing.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Glanzer and Cunitz (1966) find about the serial position effect?",
      "answer": "Glanzer and Cunitz (1966) found that when recalling a list of words, people tend to remember the first and last items better than those in the middle, demonstrating the primacy and recency effects.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does encoding differ in short-term and long-term memory?",
      "answer": "Short-term memory primarily encodes information acoustically, while long-term memory encodes information semantically, based on meaning.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Baddeley (1966) find about encoding in short-term memory?",
      "answer": "Baddeley (1966) found that short-term memory is more likely to confuse acoustically similar words, suggesting it primarily encodes information acoustically.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is retrieval according to the multi-store model?",
      "answer": "Retrieval is the process of accessing and bringing information from long-term memory back to short-term memory for use.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the term 'chunking' in the context of memory.",
      "answer": "Chunking is a memory technique that involves grouping individual pieces of information into larger, meaningful units, which can increase the capacity of short-term memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the multi-store model to this scenario: A student remembers the first few items on a list better than the middle ones.",
      "answer": "This scenario demonstrates the primacy effect, where items at the beginning of a list are better remembered due to longer rehearsal in short-term memory, enhancing transfer to long-term memory.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the multi-store model apply to learning a new language?",
      "answer": "Learning a language involves encoding vocabulary in short-term memory through rehearsal, which then transfers to long-term memory for retention and retrieval during conversations.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the multi-store model to this scenario: Forgetting a phone number quickly after hearing it.",
      "answer": "This scenario illustrates the short duration of short-term memory, where information like a phone number is forgotten quickly if not rehearsed or transferred to long-term memory.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the multi-store model explain revising for an exam?",
      "answer": "Revising involves rehearsing information in short-term memory, which strengthens the transfer and storage in long-term memory, improving retrieval during an exam.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "A strength of the multi-store model is its ability to explain the distinction between short-term and long-term memory, supported by evidence such as the serial position effect.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "A limitation of the multi-store model is its oversimplification of memory processes, ignoring the complexity of interactions between different memory stores and processes like retrieval.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Peterson and Peterson (1959).",
      "answer": "Peterson and Peterson's (1959) study used a controlled lab experiment, providing reliable results but lacking ecological validity due to artificial tasks that may not reflect real-world memory use.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Glanzer and Cunitz (1966).",
      "answer": "Glanzer and Cunitz (1966) used a lab experiment, affirming the serial position effect, but the artificial setting may limit generalizability to everyday memory tasks.",
      "ao": "AO3"
