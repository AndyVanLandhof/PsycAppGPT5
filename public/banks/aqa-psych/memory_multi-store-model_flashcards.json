    {
      "question": "What is the multi-store model of memory?",
      "answer": "The multi-store model is a theory by Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968) suggesting memory consists of three stores: sensory register, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM).",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define sensory register in the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "The sensory register is the initial stage of memory where sensory information is stored briefly before transferring to short-term memory, if attended to.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the duration of short-term memory according to the model?",
      "answer": "Short-term memory has a duration of approximately 18-30 seconds without rehearsal.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is information transferred from STM to LTM?",
      "answer": "Information is transferred from STM to LTM through rehearsal, especially elaborative rehearsal that involves deep processing of information.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Miller (1956) find about STM capacity?",
      "answer": "Miller (1956) found that the capacity of short-term memory is 7±2 items or chunks of information.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define long-term memory in the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "Long-term memory is the final stage in the multi-store model, where information is stored indefinitely and has a potentially unlimited capacity.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the encoding process in STM?",
      "answer": "In STM, encoding is primarily acoustic, meaning information is stored based on how it sounds.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the encoding process in LTM?",
      "answer": "In LTM, encoding is primarily semantic, meaning information is stored based on its meaning.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Peterson & Peterson (1959) find about STM duration?",
      "answer": "Peterson & Peterson (1959) found that STM duration is around 18 seconds without rehearsal.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does attention play in the multi-store model?",
      "answer": "Attention is crucial for transferring information from the sensory register to short-term memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define rehearsal in the context of the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "Rehearsal involves the repeated practice of information to maintain it in STM and transfer it to LTM.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bahrick et al. (1975) find about LTM duration?",
      "answer": "Bahrick et al. (1975) found that LTM can retain information for a lifetime, as shown by participants recalling classmates decades after graduation.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the multi-store model to this scenario: A student repeatedly reads notes to remember them for an exam.",
      "answer": "The student uses rehearsal to transfer information from STM to LTM, as per the multi-store model.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the multi-store model explain forgetting in STM?",
      "answer": "Forgetting in STM occurs due to decay of information without rehearsal or displacement by new information.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the multi-store model to a scenario where someone forgets a phone number after hearing it once.",
      "answer": "The person did not rehearse the number, leading to forgetting due to STM's limited duration.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the multi-store model account for the primacy effect?",
      "answer": "The primacy effect occurs as the first items received more rehearsal, transferring them to LTM.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "A strength is its empirical support from studies like Peterson & Peterson (1959), which confirm the distinct duration and capacity of STM.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the multi-store model.",
      "answer": "A limitation is that it oversimplifies memory processes and doesn't account for the complexity of STM, such as shown in Baddeley's working memory model.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Miller's (1956) study on STM.",
      "answer": "Miller's study used controlled lab conditions, providing reliable results, but it lacks ecological validity as the tasks don't reflect real-life memory use.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Peterson & Peterson's (1959) study.",
      "answer": "Their study had high control over variables, providing reliable data on STM duration, but artificial tasks may not represent everyday memory processes.",
      "ao": "AO3"
