    {
      "question": "What is a correlation in psychology?",
      "answer": "A correlation is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables change together.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define a positive correlation.",
      "answer": "A positive correlation occurs when two variables increase together, indicating a direct relationship.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define a negative correlation.",
      "answer": "A negative correlation occurs when one variable increases as the other decreases, indicating an inverse relationship.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a zero correlation?",
      "answer": "Zero correlation means no relationship exists between two variables; changes in one do not predict changes in the other.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Cohen (1988) contribute to correlation studies?",
      "answer": "Cohen (1988) provided guidelines for interpreting the strength of correlation coefficients: small (.1), medium (.3), large (.5).",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define correlation coefficient.",
      "answer": "A correlation coefficient is a numerical value between -1 and +1 that indicates the strength and direction of a relationship.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the range of correlation coefficients?",
      "answer": "Correlation coefficients range from -1 to +1, representing perfect negative to perfect positive correlations.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define causation in relation to correlation.",
      "answer": "Causation implies that changes in one variable directly cause changes in another, which correlations do not establish.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Hume (1748) state about correlation and causation?",
      "answer": "Hume (1748) argued that correlation does not imply causation, emphasizing that observed relationships require further investigation.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a scatterplot?",
      "answer": "A scatterplot is a graph that displays the values of two variables to identify the type of correlation between them.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define spurious correlation.",
      "answer": "A spurious correlation is an apparent relationship between two variables caused by a third variable.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is meant by 'direction of causality'?",
      "answer": "Direction of causality refers to which variable is the cause and which is the effect, often ambiguous in correlations.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply correlation to this scenario: A study finds a correlation between exercise and happiness.",
      "answer": "The correlation suggests that increased exercise is associated with higher happiness levels, but it does not establish causality.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does correlation apply to this scenario: Students' study time and exam scores?",
      "answer": "A positive correlation would indicate that more study time is associated with higher exam scores, but causality is not confirmed.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply correlation to this scenario: Temperature and ice cream sales.",
      "answer": "A positive correlation would suggest that as temperature increases, ice cream sales also increase, but this does not imply causation.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does correlation apply to this scenario: Social media use and self-esteem?",
      "answer": "A negative correlation might indicate that increased social media use is associated with lower self-esteem, but causation is not established.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of using correlations in research.",
      "answer": "Correlations allow researchers to identify relationships between variables, which can guide further experimental research.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of correlational studies.",
      "answer": "Correlational studies cannot establish causal relationships, limiting their ability to determine cause and effect.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of correlational research.",
      "answer": "Correlational research often uses naturalistic settings, which increases ecological validity but may lack control over extraneous variables.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give a methodological critique of using scatterplots in correlation research.",
      "answer": "Scatterplots can visually display relationships but may be misinterpreted if the scale or data points are not accurately represented.",
      "ao": "AO3"
