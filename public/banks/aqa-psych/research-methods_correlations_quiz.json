      "question": "What is the main purpose of using a correlation in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "To examine the relationship between two variables",
        "To establish a cause-and-effect relationship",
        "To manipulate variables in a controlled environment",
        "To provide in-depth qualitative data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO1",
      "explanation": "Correlations assess the strength and direction of a relationship between two variables but do not imply causation."

      "question": "Which of the following correlation coefficients represents the strongest relationship?",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO1",
      "explanation": "The coefficient -0.85 indicates a strong negative relationship, as closer proximity to -1.00 or 1.00 indicates stronger relationships."

      "id": "correlations-q3",
      "question": "Which statement best describes a positive correlation?",
      "options": [
        "As one variable increases, the other variable also increases",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO1",
      "explanation": "A positive correlation indicates that both variables move in the same direction; as one increases, so does the other."

        "Confounding variables"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "ao": "AO1",
      "explanation": "Correlational studies do not manipulate an independent variable; they only measure the existing variables."

      "question": "What is the main difference between a correlation and an experiment?",
      "options": [

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO1",
      "explanation": "Experiments manipulate variables to determine causation, whereas correlations only examine relationships between variables."

        "Temperature and energy consumption"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO1",
      "explanation": "Ice cream sales and drownings both increase in the summer, but the relationship is due to a third variable (temperature)."

      "id": "correlations-q10",
      "question": "A researcher finds a correlation of 0.65 between time spent studying and exam scores. What can be concluded from this finding?",
      "options": [
        "There is a moderate positive relationship between studying and exam scores",
        "Studying causes an increase in exam scores",
        "There is no relationship between studying and exam scores",
        "Studying more decreases exam scores"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO2",
      "explanation": "A correlation of 0.65 suggests a moderate positive relationship, meaning that more studying is associated with higher exam scores."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO2",
      "explanation": "A correlation of 0.15 indicates a weak positive relationship, as it is close to zero and on the positive side of the scale."

      "id": "correlations-q13",
      "question": "How can the direction of causation be a limitation in correlational research?",
      "options": [
        "It cannot be determined from correlation alone",
        "It requires a large sample size",
        "It ensures high internal validity",

        "It can create a spurious correlation",
        "It eliminates the relationship between variables",
        "It increases the reliability of findings",
