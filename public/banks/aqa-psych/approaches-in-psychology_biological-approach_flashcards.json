    {
      "question": "What is the main assumption of the biological approach in psychology?",
      "answer": "The biological approach assumes that behavior is a result of genetic, neurochemical, and physiological processes.",
      "ao": "AO1"

    {
      "question": "Define 'genotype' in the context of the biological approach.",
      "answer": "Genotype refers to an individual's genetic makeup, including all of their genes and hereditary information.",

    {
      "question": "Define 'phenotype' in the context of the biological approach.",
      "answer": "Phenotype is the observable characteristics of an individual, resulting from the interaction of genotype and environment.",
      "ao": "AO1"

    {
      "question": "What role do neurotransmitters play according to the biological approach?",
      "answer": "Neurotransmitters are chemicals that transmit signals across a synapse from one neuron to another, influencing behavior and mental processes.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Gottesman and Shields (1972) find about schizophrenia?",
      "answer": "Gottesman and Shields (1972) found a higher concordance rate for schizophrenia among monozygotic twins (48%) compared to dizygotic twins (17%), suggesting a genetic component.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Raine et al. (1997) find about brain activity in murderers?",
      "answer": "Raine et al. (1997) found that murderers pleading NGRI had reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, implicating brain structure in aggressive behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the hypothalamus in the biological approach?",
      "answer": "The hypothalamus is involved in regulating basic bodily functions such as hunger, thirst, and temperature, influencing behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'natural selection' in the context of the biological approach.",
      "answer": "Natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Buss (1989) find about mate preferences?",
      "answer": "Buss (1989) found that men prefer youthful and physically attractive partners, while women prefer resource-rich partners, supporting evolutionary explanations of behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of hormones according to the biological approach?",
      "answer": "Hormones are chemical messengers secreted by glands that regulate physiological and behavioral functions such as mood, growth, and metabolism.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'heritability' in the context of the biological approach.",
      "answer": "Heritability refers to the proportion of variation in a trait attributable to genetic factors within a population.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Maguire et al. (2000) find about London taxi drivers?",
      "answer": "Maguire et al. (2000) found that London taxi drivers had larger hippocampi, suggesting brain plasticity related to spatial navigation skills.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the biological approach to this scenario: A person has developed depression after a stressful life event.",
      "answer": "The biological approach would consider whether genetic predisposition and neurochemical imbalances, possibly triggered by stress, contributed to the depression.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the biological approach explain aggression in a teenager with high testosterone levels?",
      "answer": "The biological approach would attribute the teenager's aggression to elevated testosterone levels, a hormone linked to increased aggressive behavior.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the biological approach to explain anxiety in someone with an overactive amygdala.",
      "answer": "The biological approach suggests that an overactive amygdala, a brain region involved in processing fear, may contribute to heightened anxiety.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the biological approach explain a child's musical talent inherited from parents?",
      "answer": "The biological approach would attribute the child's musical talent to genetic inheritance, suggesting a hereditary basis for the skill.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the biological approach.",
      "answer": "A strength of the biological approach is its scientific rigor, employing objective methods such as brain scans and genetic testing.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the biological approach.",
      "answer": "A limitation is that it may oversimplify complex behaviors by ignoring environmental and social factors, leading to reductionist explanations.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Raine et al. (1997) study.",
      "answer": "Raine et al. (1997) used PET scans, providing objective data on brain activity, but the study's correlational nature limits causality conclusions.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Gottesman and Shields (1972) study.",
      "answer": "Their twin study design helps isolate genetic factors, but shared environments in twins might confound results, complicating nature vs. nurture conclusions.",
