    {
      "question": "What role do neurotransmitters play in the biological approach?",

      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Broca (1861) find about brain areas?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What did Wernicke (1874) discover about language processing?",
      "answer": "Wernicke identified a brain area responsible for language comprehension, located in the left temporal lobe, known as Wernicke's area.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'heritability' in terms of psychological traits.",
      "answer": "Heritability is the proportion of variation in a trait within a population that can be attributed to genetic factors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an evolutionary explanation for behavior?",
      "answer": "Evolutionary explanations suggest behaviors have developed through natural selection to enhance survival and reproduction.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Raine et al. (1997) find about brain abnormalities?",
      "answer": "Raine et al. found that murderers pleading NGRI had reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, linked to impulsive behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'neuroplasticity' in the biological approach.",
      "answer": "Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to experience, learning, or injury.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the hypothalamus in behavior?",
      "answer": "The hypothalamus regulates basic drives such as hunger, thirst, and the fight-or-flight response.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are twin studies used for in the biological approach?",
      "answer": "Twin studies compare monozygotic and dizygotic twins to assess the genetic basis of behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the biological approach apply to depression treatment?",
      "answer": "The biological approach suggests using antidepressants to correct neurotransmitter imbalances, such as serotonin deficiency.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the biological approach to explaining aggression in a scenario.",
      "answer": "Increased testosterone levels or genetic predispositions could explain aggressive behavior in competitive sports.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the biological approach be applied to phobias?",
      "answer": "Phobias may be explained by evolutionary preparedness, where certain fears are adaptive for survival.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the biological approach to a scenario involving addiction.",
      "answer": "Genetic predispositions and changes in dopamine pathways could explain the vulnerability to substance addiction.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the biological approach.",
      "answer": "The biological approach is scientific, using objective methods like brain scans for reliable data.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the biological approach.",
      "answer": "The biological approach can be reductionist, overlooking environmental and psychological influences on behavior.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Raine et al. (1997) study.",
