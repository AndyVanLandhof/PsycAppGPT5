    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of cultural variations to this scenario: A Japanese infant is very distressed during separation.",
      "answer": "The distress may reflect the high prevalence of insecure-resistant attachments in Japan, where infants are less accustomed to separation.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does cultural context apply to a German infant showing little distress during separation?",
      "answer": "This behavior aligns with German cultural values of independence, possibly leading to an insecure-avoidant attachment style.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of collectivist culture to an infant raised in a close-knit community.",
      "answer": "The infant may develop an insecure-resistant attachment due to constant close proximity with caregivers, reflecting collectivist cultural norms.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does an individualistic culture apply to a child's independence in play?",
