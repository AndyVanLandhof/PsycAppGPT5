    {
      "question": "What is the nature-nurture debate?",
      "answer": "The nature-nurture debate concerns the relative importance of genetic inheritance (nature) versus environmental influences (nurture) on human behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'heritability'.",
      "answer": "Heritability is the proportion of variance in a trait within a population that is attributed to genetic differences.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Gottesman and Shields (1966) find about schizophrenia?",
      "answer": "Gottesman and Shields found higher concordance rates for schizophrenia in MZ twins (42%) compared to DZ twins (9%), suggesting a genetic influence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'nurture' aspect of the debate?",
      "answer": "Nurture refers to the environmental factors, including upbringing, culture, and experiences, that influence behavior and development.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'interactionism' in the nature-nurture debate.",
      "answer": "Interactionism is the perspective that both genetic and environmental factors interact and influence human behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Plomin et al. (1977) find about intelligence?",
      "answer": "Plomin et al. found that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to intelligence, supporting an interactionist approach.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'nature' aspect of the debate?",
      "answer": "Nature refers to the biological and genetic factors that influence behavior, such as genes and brain chemistry.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'epigenetics' in the context of this debate.",
      "answer": "Epigenetics involves changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the DNA sequence, often influenced by environmental factors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bouchard et al. (1990) find in their twin study?",
      "answer": "Bouchard et al. found that MZ twins reared apart had similar IQ scores, indicating a strong genetic component to intelligence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'biological determinism'.",
      "answer": "Biological determinism is the belief that behavior is controlled entirely by genetic and biological factors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is environmental determinism?",
      "answer": "Environmental determinism is the belief that behavior is shaped solely by environmental factors and experiences.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'gene-environment interaction'.",
      "answer": "Gene-environment interaction occurs when the effect of an environmental factor on behavior is dependent on an individual's genetic makeup.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of 'nature' to the development of language in children.",
      "answer": "Language development might be attributed to innate biological structures, like Chomsky's LAD, suggesting a strong nature influence.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the nurture perspective apply to aggression?",
      "answer": "Aggression could be seen as a learned behavior through environmental influences like social learning, as Bandura's Bobo doll study suggests.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the interactionist approach to explaining depression.",
      "answer": "Depression might result from a genetic predisposition triggered by stressful life events, reflecting both nature and nurture influences.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does epigenetics apply to the nature-nurture debate?",
      "answer": "Epigenetics shows that environmental factors can affect gene expression, demonstrating the interplay between nature and nurture.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the interactionist approach.",
      "answer": "The interactionist approach is supported by evidence that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to complex behaviors, offering a comprehensive explanation.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the nature perspective.",
      "answer": "The nature perspective may neglect the role of environmental influences, leading to an oversimplified understanding of behavior.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Bouchard et al. (1990) twin study.",
      "answer": "The study's strength is its control over genetic variables, but its limitation is potential environmental variation among separated twins.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodological issues in Gottesman and Shields (1966).",
      "answer": "The study's reliance on concordance rates may overlook environmental factors, but it highlights a possible genetic link to schizophrenia.",
      "ao": "AO3"
