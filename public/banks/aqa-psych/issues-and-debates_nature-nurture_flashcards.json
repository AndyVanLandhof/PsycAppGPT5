    {
      "question": "What is the nature-nurture debate?",
      "answer": "The nature-nurture debate concerns whether human behavior is determined by genetics (nature) or environment and experience (nurture).",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'nature' in the context of the nature-nurture debate.",
      "answer": "'Nature' refers to the influence of genetic inheritance and other biological factors on behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'nurture' in the context of the nature-nurture debate.",
      "answer": "'Nurture' refers to the influence of external factors such as environment, experience, and learning on behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Plomin et al. (1997) find about intelligence?",
      "answer": "Plomin et al. (1997) found that intelligence has a significant genetic component, with heritability estimates around 50%.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the interactionist approach in the nature-nurture debate?",
      "answer": "The interactionist approach suggests that nature and nurture interact in complex ways to shape behavior and characteristics.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is epigenetics?",
      "answer": "Epigenetics involves changes in gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the DNA sequence, often due to environmental influences.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Rutter et al. (2001) find about Romanian orphans?",
      "answer": "Rutter et al. (2001) found that Romanian orphans adopted before six months of age showed significant developmental catch-up, highlighting the impact of nurture.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'heritability'.",
      "answer": "Heritability is a statistical measure indicating the extent to which genetic factors account for variations in a trait within a population.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did the Minnesota Twin Study (Bouchard et al., 1990) find about personality?",
      "answer": "The study found that identical twins reared apart had similar personality traits, suggesting a strong genetic influence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the diathesis-stress model?",
      "answer": "The diathesis-stress model posits that psychological disorders develop due to a genetic vulnerability (diathesis) triggered by environmental stressors.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Bandura (1977) contribute to the nurture side of the debate?",
      "answer": "Bandura's social learning theory emphasized the role of observational learning and imitation, highlighting environmental influences on behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'gene-environment correlation'.",
      "answer": "Gene-environment correlation occurs when an individual's genetic makeup influences their exposure to certain environments.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the interactionist approach apply to phobias?",
      "answer": "In phobias, genetic predispositions (nature) may interact with traumatic experiences (nurture), leading to the development of irrational fears.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply epigenetics to a scenario where a child develops obesity.",
      "answer": "A child with a genetic predisposition to obesity may experience changes in gene expression due to poor diet and lack of exercise (nurture), leading to obesity.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the diathesis-stress model apply to depression?",
      "answer": "An individual with a genetic vulnerability to depression may develop the disorder when exposed to significant life stressors, such as bereavement.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply gene-environment correlation to intelligence.",
      "answer": "Children with high genetic potential for intelligence may seek out intellectually stimulating environments, enhancing their cognitive skills further.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the nature-nurture debate.",
      "answer": "The debate highlights the importance of both genetic and environmental factors, encouraging a holistic understanding of human behavior.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of focusing solely on nature.",
      "answer": "Focusing only on nature may lead to deterministic views, ignoring the potential for change through environmental interventions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of the Minnesota Twin Study.",
      "answer": "The study used a large, diverse sample of twins, enhancing generalizability. However, the reliance on self-report data may introduce bias.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Rutter et al.'s study on Romanian orphans.",
      "answer": "The longitudinal design provided rich insights into developmental changes. However, lack of control over pre-adoption conditions limits causal conclusions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
