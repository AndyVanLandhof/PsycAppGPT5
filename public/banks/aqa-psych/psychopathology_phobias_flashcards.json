    {
      "question": "What is a phobia?",
      "answer": "A phobia is an irrational fear of an object or situation that is disproportionate to the actual danger posed.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'agoraphobia'.",
      "answer": "Agoraphobia is the fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or help unavailable, often leading to avoidance of open or crowded spaces.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Watson and Rayner (1920) find about phobias?",
      "answer": "Watson and Rayner demonstrated that phobias could be classically conditioned in their study with Little Albert, who developed a fear of white rats.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'systematic desensitization'.",
      "answer": "Systematic desensitization is a behavioral therapy that reduces phobic anxiety through gradual exposure to the feared stimulus paired with relaxation techniques.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'flooding' in the treatment of phobias?",
      "answer": "Flooding is a behavioral treatment for phobias involving immediate and intense exposure to the phobic stimulus without gradual buildup, aiming to extinguish the fear response.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Mowrer (1947) propose about phobia acquisition?",
      "answer": "Mowrer proposed the two-process model, suggesting phobias are acquired through classical conditioning and maintained through operant conditioning.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'preparedness' in the context of phobias.",
      "answer": "Preparedness is the evolutionary predisposition to develop certain phobias more easily because they historically posed threats to survival.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'social phobia'?",
      "answer": "Social phobia, or social anxiety disorder, is an intense fear of social situations due to concerns about being judged or embarrassed.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Ost et al. (1991) find about genetic factors in phobias?",
      "answer": "Ost et al. found a higher concordance rate for blood-injection-injury phobia in identical twins compared to fraternal twins, suggesting a genetic component.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'cognitive-behavioral therapy' (CBT) for phobias.",
      "answer": "CBT for phobias involves altering distorted thoughts about the feared object or situation, combined with exposure to reduce anxiety.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'virtual reality exposure therapy'?",
      "answer": "Virtual reality exposure therapy uses VR technology to simulate phobic situations, allowing safe, controlled exposure to reduce anxiety.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Di Nardo et al. (1988) find about phobias?",
      "answer": "Di Nardo et al. found that not everyone who experiences a traumatic event develops a phobia, indicating that cognitive factors may play a role.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does classical conditioning apply to a fear of dogs?",
      "answer": "A person may associate a neutral stimulus (dog) with an unconditioned stimulus (bite) that produces fear, leading to a conditioned fear response to dogs.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply systematic desensitization to a fear of flying.",
      "answer": "Systematic desensitization for flying would involve creating a fear hierarchy, starting with imagining a plane and gradually progressing to boarding a flight, paired with relaxation techniques.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How might operant conditioning maintain a fear of heights?",
      "answer": "Avoiding heights reduces anxiety, negatively reinforcing avoidance behavior, thereby maintaining the phobia through operant conditioning.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of preparedness to explain a fear of snakes.",
      "answer": "A fear of snakes may be explained by evolutionary preparedness, as snakes posed a historical threat, making individuals more prone to develop this phobia.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the two-process model.",
      "answer": "The two-process model is supported by empirical evidence, such as Watson and Rayner's study, demonstrating the role of conditioning in phobia acquisition.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Watson and Rayner (1920).",
      "answer": "Watson and Rayner's study lacked ethical standards, as Little Albert was subjected to distress without informed consent or debriefing, raising ethical concerns.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of systematic desensitization.",
      "answer": "Systematic desensitization may not address underlying cognitive factors, limiting its effectiveness for phobias with cognitive components beyond behavioral symptoms.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the use of flooding in treating phobias.",
      "answer": "Flooding can be highly effective and fast but may cause significant distress, leading to ethical concerns and high dropout rates due to its intensity.",
      "ao": "AO3"
