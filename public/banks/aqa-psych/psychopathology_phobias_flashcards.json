    {
      "question": "What did Menzies and Clarke (1993) find about phobias?",
      "answer": "Menzies and Clarke (1993) found that many phobias are acquired through classical conditioning and maintained through operant conditioning.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'social phobia'.",
      "answer": "Social phobia, or social anxiety disorder, is the fear of social situations where one might be embarrassed or judged.",

    {
      "question": "What is agoraphobia?",
      "answer": "Agoraphobia is the fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or help unavailable, often leading to avoidance of places.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'classical conditioning' in the context of phobias.",
      "answer": "Classical conditioning is a learning process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a fear response, contributing to phobia development.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does operant conditioning play in phobias?",
      "answer": "Operant conditioning maintains phobias through negative reinforcement, where avoiding the phobic stimulus reduces anxiety, reinforcing avoidance behavior.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Watson and Rayner (1920) demonstrate with Little Albert?",
      "answer": "Watson and Rayner (1920) demonstrated that phobias could be conditioned in humans by associating a neutral stimulus with a frightening event.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'systematic desensitization'.",
      "answer": "Systematic desensitization is a behavioral therapy technique that reduces phobic anxiety through gradual exposure to the feared object or situation.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is flooding therapy?",
      "answer": "Flooding is a behavioral therapy that exposes patients to their phobic stimulus without gradual buildup to extinguish the fear response quickly.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Öst (1987) find about flooding?",
      "answer": "Öst (1987) found flooding to be an effective treatment for phobias, with rapid exposure leading to quick extinction of the fear response.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'cognitive-behavioral therapy' (CBT) for phobias.",
      "answer": "CBT for phobias involves changing maladaptive thoughts and behaviors associated with the phobic stimulus, combining cognitive restructuring with exposure techniques.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does classical conditioning apply to a fear of dogs?",
      "answer": "A person bitten by a dog may develop a fear of dogs through classical conditioning, associating dogs (neutral stimulus) with pain and fear (unconditioned response).",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply operant conditioning to this scenario: A person avoids elevators due to claustrophobia.",
      "answer": "Avoiding elevators reduces anxiety, negatively reinforcing the avoidance behavior, thus maintaining the phobia through operant conditioning.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does systematic desensitization apply to a fear of heights?",
      "answer": "A person gradually exposed to increasing heights, starting with pictures and moving to real situations, learns to manage anxiety through relaxation techniques.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply cognitive-behavioral therapy to a fear of public speaking.",
      "answer": "CBT helps a person identify irrational thoughts about public speaking and gradually exposes them to speaking situations to reduce anxiety.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of systematic desensitization.",
      "answer": "Systematic desensitization is effective for a wide range of phobias, with a high success rate due to gradual exposure and relaxation techniques.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of flooding therapy.",
      "answer": "Flooding can be highly distressing and traumatic for phobia patients, leading to potential dropouts and ethical concerns regarding patient welfare.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Watson and Rayner's (1920) study.",
      "answer": "Watson and Rayner's study lacked ecological validity and had ethical issues, as it deliberately induced fear in a child without informed consent.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the behavioral approach to phobias.",
      "answer": "The behavioral approach neglects cognitive factors, focusing solely on observable behavior, which may oversimplify complex phobic responses.",
      "ao": "AO3"
