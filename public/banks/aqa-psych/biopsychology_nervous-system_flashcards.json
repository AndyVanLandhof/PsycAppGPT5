    {
      "question": "What is the function of the central nervous system (CNS)?",
      "answer": "The CNS processes information received from the sensory organs and sends instructions for action to the body. It consists of the brain and spinal cord.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the peripheral nervous system (PNS).",
      "answer": "The PNS connects the CNS to limbs and organs. It consists of the somatic and autonomic nervous systems.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the somatic nervous system?",
      "answer": "The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements by transmitting signals from the CNS to skeletal muscles.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the autonomic nervous system (ANS).",
      "answer": "The ANS regulates involuntary bodily functions, such as heart rate and digestion. It includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of the sympathetic nervous system?",
      "answer": "The sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for 'fight or flight' responses by increasing heart rate and energy availability.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the parasympathetic nervous system play?",
      "answer": "The parasympathetic nervous system conserves energy and promotes 'rest and digest' activities by slowing heart rate and aiding digestion.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Taylor et al. (2000) find about the 'tend and befriend' response?",
      "answer": "Taylor et al. found that females often exhibit a 'tend and befriend' response to stress, involving nurturing and seeking social support, as an alternative to 'fight or flight'.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of sensory neurons?",
      "answer": "Sensory neurons transmit information from sensory receptors to the CNS, allowing the brain to process sensory experiences.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define motor neurons.",
      "answer": "Motor neurons carry instructions from the CNS to muscles and glands, facilitating movement and responses.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of relay neurons?",
      "answer": "Relay neurons connect sensory and motor neurons within the CNS, enabling communication and signal processing.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Cannon (1932) propose about the autonomic nervous system?",
      "answer": "Cannon proposed the 'fight or flight' model, suggesting the autonomic nervous system prepares the body to confront or flee from threats.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define homeostasis in the context of the ANS.",
      "answer": "Homeostasis refers to the ANS's role in maintaining a stable internal environment by regulating bodily functions like temperature and heart rate.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the ANS apply to a stressful job interview scenario?",
      "answer": "The sympathetic nervous system would activate, increasing heart rate and energy, preparing the candidate to perform well under stress.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the somatic nervous system to playing a musical instrument.",
      "answer": "The somatic nervous system controls finger movements and coordination, allowing a musician to play notes and rhythms accurately.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the PNS apply to recovering from exercise?",
      "answer": "The parasympathetic nervous system aids recovery by slowing the heart rate and promoting digestion and energy restoration post-exercise.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of the 'fight or flight' response to a surprise encounter with a wild animal.",
      "answer": "The sympathetic nervous system would trigger an increased heart rate and adrenaline release, preparing the body to either confront or escape the animal.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the 'fight or flight' response model.",
      "answer": "The model is supported by empirical evidence showing physiological changes under stress, such as increased heart rate, providing a clear biological basis.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the 'fight or flight' response model.",
      "answer": "The model is limited as it overlooks gender differences, such as the 'tend and befriend' response observed in females.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Cannon's (1932) study on 'fight or flight'.",
      "answer": "Cannon's study used animal models, which may limit generalizability to human responses due to species differences in stress reactions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the role of the parasympathetic nervous system in stress recovery.",
      "answer": "The parasympathetic nervous system effectively counteracts the sympathetic response, but individual differences in recovery speed may limit the general applicability of this role.",
      "ao": "AO3"
