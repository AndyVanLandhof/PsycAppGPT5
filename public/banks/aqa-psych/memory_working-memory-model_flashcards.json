    {
      "question": "What is the working memory model?",
      "answer": "Proposed by Baddeley and Hitch (1974), it describes a multi-component system for temporary storage and manipulation of information.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the central executive in the working memory model.",
      "answer": "The central executive is the component that directs attention and coordinates the activities of the other components.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the phonological loop?",
      "answer": "The phonological loop is a component of working memory that deals with auditory information and language.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the visuo-spatial sketchpad.",
      "answer": "The visuo-spatial sketchpad is a component that processes visual and spatial information, often referred to as the 'inner eye'.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the episodic buffer?",
      "answer": "Introduced by Baddeley (2000), the episodic buffer integrates information from other components and long-term memory into a single complex structure.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Baddeley et al. (1975) find about the phonological loop?",
      "answer": "They found that people have difficulty remembering lists of long words compared to short words, supporting the phonological loop's capacity limitation.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define articulatory suppression.",
      "answer": "Articulatory suppression involves repeating an irrelevant sound, preventing rehearsal in the phonological loop, thereby impairing memory performance.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence supports the visuo-spatial sketchpad?",
      "answer": "Baddeley and Hitch (1974) showed that participants struggled with simultaneous visual and spatial tasks, indicating separate processing resources.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Logie (1995) propose about the visuo-spatial sketchpad?",
      "answer": "Logie suggested it consists of two parts: the visual cache (stores information) and the inner scribe (processes spatial and movement information).",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the episodic buffer?",
      "answer": "It serves as a temporary store that integrates information from different sources and maintains a sense of time sequencing.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the working memory model differ from the multi-store model?",
      "answer": "Unlike the unitary short-term memory in the multi-store model, the working memory model proposes multiple components for processing different information types.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is dual-task performance in the working memory model?",
      "answer": "Dual-task performance involves performing two tasks simultaneously, supporting separate components in working memory when tasks don't interfere.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the working memory model to this scenario: A student struggles to listen to a lecture while taking detailed notes.",
      "answer": "This scenario illustrates the limited capacity of the central executive, which struggles to divide attention between auditory and manual tasks.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the phonological loop apply to learning a new language?",
      "answer": "The phonological loop aids in learning new vocabulary by temporarily storing and rehearsing sounds, facilitating language acquisition.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the visuo-spatial sketchpad to a scenario: Navigating a new city using a map.",
      "answer": "The visuo-spatial sketchpad allows processing of spatial information from the map, assisting in navigation and orientation.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the episodic buffer apply to reading a novel?",
      "answer": "The episodic buffer integrates textual information with existing knowledge, allowing readers to create a cohesive narrative understanding.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the working memory model.",
      "answer": "It offers a more detailed explanation of short-term memory processes compared to the multi-store model, supported by experimental evidence.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the working memory model.",
      "answer": "The central executive's exact function remains vague and difficult to test experimentally, indicating an incomplete understanding.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Baddeley et al. (1975) study on word length effect.",
      "answer": "The controlled lab setting provides strong internal validity, but artificial tasks limit ecological validity and generalization.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of dual-task studies in working memory research.",
      "answer": "Dual-task studies demonstrate processing capacity, but often use artificial stimuli, limiting ecological validity and real-world application.",
      "ao": "AO3"
