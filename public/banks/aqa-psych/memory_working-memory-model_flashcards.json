    {
      "question": "What is the working memory model?",
      "answer": "A model proposed by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) to replace the short-term memory store with multiple components handling different information types.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the central executive in the working memory model.",
      "answer": "The central executive is responsible for directing attention and processing resources to various slave systems in the working memory model.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of the phonological loop?",
      "answer": "The phonological loop processes auditory information and preserves the order of information through its phonological store and articulatory control process.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the visuo-spatial sketchpad.",
      "answer": "The visuo-spatial sketchpad stores visual and spatial information and is used for navigation and the manipulation of visual images.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Baddeley et al. (1975) find about word length effect?",
      "answer": "Shorter words are recalled more easily than longer words due to the phonological loop's limited capacity, known as the word length effect.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the episodic buffer play?",
      "answer": "Introduced by Baddeley in 2000, the episodic buffer integrates information from the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and long-term memory.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Logie (1995) propose about the visuo-spatial sketchpad?",
      "answer": "Logie proposed that the visuo-spatial sketchpad consists of a visual cache for shape and color, and an inner scribe for spatial and movement information.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define the articulatory suppression effect.",
      "answer": "Articulatory suppression is the interference with the phonological loop's function by repeating irrelevant sounds, which hinders verbal memory tasks.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Baddeley et al. (1973) find about dual-task performance?",
      "answer": "Baddeley et al. found that performing two tasks simultaneously is easier when they use different components of the working memory model.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the capacity of the phonological loop?",
      "answer": "The phonological loop has a limited capacity, typically enough to hold about 2 seconds worth of spoken information.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'slave systems' in the working memory model.",
      "answer": "Slave systems are components of the working memory model, including the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad, that are controlled by the central executive.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Baddeley (1996) suggest about the central executive's role in attention?",
      "answer": "Baddeley suggested that the central executive's role is akin to a supervisor, managing attention and switching between tasks.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the working memory model to this scenario: A student struggles to follow verbal instructions while copying diagrams.",
      "answer": "The student's difficulty suggests a limited capacity in the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad, highlighting the need for separate processing of auditory and visual information.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the working memory model apply to multitasking?",
      "answer": "Multitasking is more efficient when tasks use different components of the working memory model, reducing interference within a single component.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of articulatory suppression to a scenario where a person repeats a word while memorizing a list.",
      "answer": "Repeating a word while memorizing a list uses the articulatory control process, hindering the phonological loop's ability to process the list, leading to reduced recall.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the episodic buffer apply to integrating information from multiple sources?",
      "answer": "The episodic buffer integrates information from the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and long-term memory, facilitating comprehensive understanding and recall.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the working memory model.",
      "answer": "The working memory model is supported by dual-task studies showing separate processing systems, providing a detailed understanding of short-term memory functions.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the working memory model.",
      "answer": "The model lacks clarity on the central executive's exact functioning, leading to criticism of its vagueness and undefined processes.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Baddeley et al.'s (1975) word length effect study.",
      "answer": "The study's controlled lab setting ensures high internal validity but lacks ecological validity, as tasks may not represent real-world memory use.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Baddeley et al.'s (1973) dual-task study.",
      "answer": "The study's experimental design provides strong evidence for separate processing systems but may not account for individual differences in multitasking ability.",
      "ao": "AO3"
