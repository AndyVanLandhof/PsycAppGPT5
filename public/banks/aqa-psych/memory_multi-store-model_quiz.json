      "question": "Which of the following is a criticism of the multi-store model of memory?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO3",

        "By emphasizing the role of sensory memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO3",
      "explanation": "The working memory model challenges the multi-store model by proposing that short-term memory consists of multiple components, not just a single store."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "ao": "AO3",
      "explanation": "Patient studies, such as those on HM, suggest the multi-store model does not account for different types of long-term memory, such as procedural and declarative."
