    {
      "question": "What does Bowlby's monotropic theory of attachment emphasize?",
      "options": [
        "The importance of multiple attachments",
        "The role of the father",
        "The significance of a primary attachment figure",
        "The influence of cultural factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Bowlby's monotropic theory emphasizes the importance of a primary attachment figure, suggesting that infants form one strong attachment that is crucial for their development. This corresponds to: The significance of a primary attachment figure."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Ainsworth's Strange Situation, which type of attachment is characterized by high levels of anxiety and resistance to comfort from the caregiver?",
      "options": [
        "Secure attachment",
        "Insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Insecure-resistant attachment",
        "Disorganized attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Insecure-resistant attachment is characterized by high levels of anxiety and ambivalence towards the caregiver, often resisting comfort when it is offered"
    },
    {
      "question": "A study found that infants raised in institutions showed signs of attachment difficulties. This supports which of Bowlby's theories?",
      "options": [
        "Learning theory",
        "Monotropic theory",
        "Maternal deprivation",
        "Cultural variations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The findings support Bowlby's theory of maternal deprivation, which posits that a lack of a primary caregiver can lead to attachment difficulties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of the internal working model in Bowlby's attachment theory?",
      "options": [
        "A model of attachment behaviors",
        "A framework for understanding relationships based on early experiences",
        "A method for measuring attachment styles",
        "A theory of cultural variations in attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The internal working model is a framework that influences how individuals perceive and interact in relationships based on their early attachment experiences. This corresponds to: A framework for understanding relationships based on early experiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing attachment styles across cultures, researchers found that Japanese children exhibited higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment. What could this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Cultural bias in attachment theory",
        "Universal attachment behaviors",
        "The effectiveness of Western parenting styles",
        "The irrelevance of attachment styles"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This finding may indicate cultural bias in attachment theory, suggesting that attachment behaviors and their interpretations can vary significantly across cultures"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes classical conditioning as it relates to attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Learning through observation",
        "Learning through reinforcement",
        "Learning through association",
        "Learning through imitation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Classical conditioning involves learning through association, where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a conditioned response"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher observes that a child shows distress when their caregiver leaves but is easily comforted upon their return. This child likely has what type of attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Insecure-avoidant",
        "Insecure-resistant",
        "Secure",
        "Disorganized"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The child's behavior indicates a secure attachment, characterized by distress when the caregiver leaves and comfort upon their return"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the learning theory of attachment?",
      "options": [
        "It ignores the role of genetics",
        "It does not account for emotional bonds",
        "It overemphasizes the importance of feeding",
        "It lacks empirical support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A limitation of the learning theory is that it overemphasizes the importance of feeding in attachment formation, neglecting the emotional bonds that develop through sensitive caregiving"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which animal study provided evidence for the importance of comfort over food in attachment formation?",
      "options": [
        "Lorenz's imprinting study",
        "Harlow's rhesus monkey study",
        "Ainsworth's Strange Situation",
        "Bowlby's maternal deprivation study"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Harlow's rhesus monkey study demonstrated that infant monkeys preferred a soft, comforting surrogate mother over a wire mother that provided food, highlighting the importance of comfort in attachment"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the critical period in Bowlby's attachment theory refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The time frame for developing multiple attachments",
        "The optimal time for forming a primary attachment",
        "The period when attachment behaviors are most observable",
        "The age at which children become independent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The critical period refers to the optimal time frame for forming a primary attachment, typically within the first few years of life. This corresponds to: The optimal time for forming a primary attachment."
