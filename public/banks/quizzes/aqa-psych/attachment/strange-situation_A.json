    {
      "question": "What was the primary aim of Ainsworth et al.'s Strange Situation (1971, 1978)?",
      "options": [
        "To assess the cognitive development of infants",
        "To systematically test the nature of attachment",
        "To evaluate parenting styles",
        "To measure infant intelligence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Strange Situation aimed to systematically test the nature of attachment in infants aged 9 to 18 months"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Ainsworth's Strange Situation, which attachment type is characterized by strong distress upon separation and conflicting behaviors upon reunion?",
      "options": [
        "Secure attachment",
        "Insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Insecure-resistant attachment",
        "Insecure-disorganised attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The insecure-resistant attachment type is marked by immediate distress upon separation and conflicting behaviors upon reunion"
    },
    {
      "question": "During the Strange Situation, which behavior is typical of securely attached infants?",
      "options": [
        "Avoiding the caregiver",
        "Showing little response to separation",
        "Seeking proximity and being easily soothed",
        "Displaying extreme distress when left alone"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Securely attached infants seek proximity to their caregiver and are easily soothed upon reunion. This corresponds to: Seeking proximity and being easily soothed."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a child shows little emotional response when their caregiver leaves and ignores them upon return, which attachment type do they likely exhibit?",
      "options": [
        "Secure attachment",
        "Insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Insecure-resistant attachment",
        "Insecure-disorganised attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This behavior is indicative of insecure-avoidant attachment, where the child avoids social interaction with the caregiver"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Main and Solomon (1986) identify as a fourth type of attachment in their analysis of the Strange Situation?",
      "options": [
        "Insecure-avoidant",
        "Insecure-resistant",
        "Secure",
        "Insecure-disorganised"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Main and Solomon proposed the insecure-disorganised type D, characterized by a lack of consistent attachment behaviors"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study of Japanese infants using the Strange Situation, what was a notable finding regarding attachment types?",
      "options": [
        "High rates of insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Similar rates of secure attachment to Ainsworth's findings",
        "Low levels of distress during separation",
        "Increased levels of secure attachment compared to American infants"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The study found similar rates of secure attachment but no evidence of insecure-avoidant attachment among Japanese infants. This corresponds to: Similar rates of secure attachment to Ainsworth's findings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological strength is associated with Ainsworth's Strange Situation regarding observer ratings?",
      "options": [
        "High levels of participant bias",
        "Low inter-observer reliability",
        "Almost perfect agreement among observers",
        "Lack of standardized procedures"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ainsworth et al. found almost perfect agreement (0.94) among observers when rating exploratory behavior, indicating high reliability. This corresponds to: Almost perfect agreement among observers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a criticism of Ainsworth's Strange Situation regarding cultural bias?",
      "options": [
        "It is universally applicable across cultures",
        "It may not account for different childrearing practices",
        "It only applies to middle-class families",
        "It lacks empirical support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Strange Situation is considered a culture-bound test, as it may not account for variations in childrearing practices across different cultures. This corresponds to: It may not account for different childrearing practices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which attachment type is characterized by a child who shows both a desire for closeness and resistance to being held?",
      "options": [
        "Secure attachment",
        "Insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Insecure-resistant attachment",
        "Insecure-disorganised attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Insecure-resistant attachment is characterized by conflicting desires for intimacy and resistance to contact"
    },
    {
      "question": "What behavior did Ainsworth et al. observe in infants during the Strange Situation that indicated attachment type?",
      "options": [
        "Exploratory behavior remained constant",
        "Crying increased as separation episodes occurred",
        "All infants displayed the same attachment behavior",
        "Infants showed no response to the caregiver"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ainsworth et al. noted that crying increased in all infants from episode 2 onwards, indicating attachment-related distress. This corresponds to: Crying increased as separation episodes occurred."
