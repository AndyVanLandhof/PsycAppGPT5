      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Anna's behavior indicates secure attachment, as she seeks comfort and resumes exploration"

      "options": [

        "Insecure-disorganised",
        "Secure"

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Main and Solomon proposed the insecure-disorganised type D, characterized by inconsistent behaviors"

      "question": "In the Strange Situation, which behavior is typical of insecure-resistant infants?",
      "options": [
        "Avoiding contact with the caregiver",
        "Showing distress upon separation",

      "question": "Kenny shows some distress when his mother leaves but allows her to comfort him upon return. What attachment type does this suggest?",

      "question": "What methodological strength is associated with Ainsworth's Strange Situation regarding inter-observer reliability?",
      "options": [
        "High levels of ecological validity",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ainsworth et al. found .94 agreement between raters, indicating strong inter-observer reliability. This corresponds to: Almost perfect agreement in exploratory behavior ratings."

      "question": "Takahashi (1990) found that Japanese infants showed no evidence of insecure-avoidant attachment. What cultural factor might explain this?",
      "options": [
        "High levels of maternal separation",
        "Cultural norms promoting independence",
        "Rare experiences of separation from mothers",
        "Increased proximity-seeking behaviors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Japanese infants rarely experience separation from their mothers, leading to higher distress in the Strange Situation. This corresponds to: Rare experiences of separation from mothers."

      "question": "What is a potential criticism of Ainsworth's Strange Situation regarding cultural bias?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks ecological validity",
        "It is a culture-bound test",
        "It does not measure attachment accurately",
        "It has low inter-observer reliability"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Strange Situation has been criticized as a culture-bound test, potentially misinterpreting attachment styles across cultures. This corresponds to: It is a culture-bound test."
