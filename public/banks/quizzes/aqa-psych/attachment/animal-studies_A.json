    {
      "question": "What was the primary finding of Harlow's study on attachment in monkeys in 1958?",
      "options": [
        "Monkeys preferred the wire mother that fed them",
        "Monkeys preferred the cloth mother for comfort",
        "Monkeys showed no preference for either mother",
        "Monkeys formed attachments only to their biological mothers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Harlow found that monkeys preferred the cloth mother, which provided comfort, over the wire mother that fed them. This corresponds to: Monkeys preferred the cloth mother for comfort."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Lorenz's 1935 study, what was the critical period for imprinting observed in goslings?",
      "options": [
        "24 hours",
        "48 hours",
        "12 hours",
        "1 week"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Lorenz demonstrated that goslings would imprint on a moving object within the first 24 hours of hatching"
    },
    {
      "question": "Harlow's research indicated that attachment is not solely based on which factor?",
      "options": [
        "Feeding",
        "Comfort",
        "Social interaction",
        "Genetics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Harlow's findings showed that attachment was not primarily based on feeding, as monkeys preferred comfort over food"
    },
    {
      "question": "A study found that the sleep/wake cycle of chipmunks disappeared after the SCN was destroyed. What does this suggest about the SCN's role?",
      "options": [
        "It is not important for sleep regulation",
        "It is essential for maintaining circadian rhythms",
        "It only affects non-human animals",
        "It can be overridden by environmental factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The study suggests that the SCN is essential for maintaining circadian rhythms, as its destruction led to the loss of the sleep/wake cycle. This corresponds to: It is essential for maintaining circadian rhythms."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ethical concern arises from Harlow's study on attachment in monkeys?",
      "options": [
        "The study lacked scientific rigor",
        "It caused lasting emotional harm to the monkeys",
        "It was not replicable",
        "It did not consider animal welfare"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Harlow's study raised ethical concerns due to the lasting emotional harm it caused, affecting the monkeys' ability to form relationships. This corresponds to: It caused lasting emotional harm to the monkeys."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of using animal studies to understand human attachment, according to the AQA materials?",
      "options": [
        "Animal studies are more ethical",
        "Humans have more complex behaviors governed by conscious decisions",
        "Animal studies provide definitive conclusions",
        "Animal behavior is identical to human behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Humans exhibit more complex behaviors influenced by conscious decisions, which may not be accurately reflected in animal studies. This corresponds to: Humans have more complex behaviors governed by conscious decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following studies supports the idea that attachment behavior observed in animals can be generalized to humans?",
      "options": [
        "Harlow's study",
        "Lorenz's study",
        "Schaffer and Emerson's study",
        "Skinner's research"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Schaffer and Emerson's study supports the idea that attachment behaviors in infants are not solely based on feeding, similar to Harlow's findings"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was a methodological issue with the learning theory of attachment based on animal studies?",
      "options": [
        "It used too many human subjects",
        "It relied on studies with non-human animals",
        "It did not consider genetic factors",
        "It was too complex to replicate"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The learning theory is criticized for relying on studies with non-human animals, which may not accurately represent human learning processes. This corresponds to: It relied on studies with non-human animals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one reason why animal studies are often used in psychological research, particularly in attachment studies?",
      "options": [
        "They are easier to conduct than human studies",
        "They provide more ethical options",
        "They allow for controlled experiments",
        "They are more reliable than human studies"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Animal studies allow for controlled experiments that can isolate specific variables, which is often more challenging in human studies. This corresponds to: They allow for controlled experiments."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the research on hormonal mechanisms in aggression suggest about animal studies?",
      "options": [
        "They are irrelevant to human aggression",
        "They provide a complete understanding of human aggression",
        "They indicate similarities in hormonal mechanisms between humans and animals",
        "They show that aggression is only learned"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Research indicates that hormonal mechanisms involved in aggression are likely similar in humans and other mammals, providing insights into the biological basis of aggression. This corresponds to: They indicate similarities in hormonal mechanisms between humans and animals."
