    {
      "question": "What was the main finding of Harlow's study on attachment in rhesus monkeys in 1958?",
      "options": [
        "Monkeys preferred the wire mother that fed them",
        "Monkeys preferred the cloth mother regardless of feeding",
        "Monkeys showed no preference for either mother",
        "Monkeys formed attachments only to their biological mothers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Harlow found that monkeys preferred the cloth mother, indicating that comfort and security are more important than food in forming attachments. This corresponds to: Monkeys preferred the cloth mother regardless of feeding."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Lorenz's 1935 study, what did he demonstrate about imprinting in goslings?",
      "options": [
        "Goslings imprint on their biological mothers only",
        "Goslings can imprint on any moving object",
        "Goslings do not imprint until they are older",
        "Goslings imprint on the first object they see regardless of its nature"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Lorenz showed that goslings would imprint on the first moving object they encountered, demonstrating the critical period for attachment. This corresponds to: Goslings imprint on the first object they see regardless of its nature."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study involving chipmunks, what was the effect of destroying the SCN connections on their behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Their sleep/wake cycle became more regular",
        "Their sleep/wake cycle disappeared",
        "They became more social",
        "They showed increased aggression"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The study found that the chipmunks lost their sleep/wake cycle, highlighting the role of the SCN in regulating biological rhythms. This corresponds to: Their sleep/wake cycle disappeared."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a significant limitation of using animal studies to understand human attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Animal studies are more ethical than human studies",
        "Human attachment is influenced by conscious decisions",
        "Animal studies provide more accurate results",
        "Animal behavior is identical to human behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Humans differ from animals in that much of their behavior is governed by conscious decisions, limiting the generalizability of animal studies. This corresponds to: Human attachment is influenced by conscious decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ethical concern is raised by Harlow's study on attachment in monkeys?",
      "options": [
        "The study was too short",
        "The monkeys experienced lasting emotional harm",
        "The study did not use a control group",
        "The monkeys were not monitored after the study"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Harlow's study caused lasting emotional harm to the monkeys, raising ethical concerns about the treatment of animals in research. This corresponds to: The monkeys experienced lasting emotional harm."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Schaffer and Emerson's findings support in relation to Harlow's research?",
      "options": [
        "Infants are most attached to the person who feeds them",
        "Infants form attachments based on comfort rather than feeding",
        "Infants do not form attachments at all",
        "Infants only attach to their biological mothers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Schaffer and Emerson found that infants were not most attached to the person who fed them, supporting Harlow's conclusion about the importance of comfort. This corresponds to: Infants form attachments based on comfort rather than feeding."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do animal studies contribute to our understanding of human eating behavior?",
      "options": [
        "They provide a complete understanding of human eating",
        "They highlight the complexity of human eating behavior",
        "They show that humans eat only for survival",
        "They demonstrate that eating behavior is identical in all species"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "While animal studies reveal similarities in neural mechanisms, they do not account for the social and psychological factors influencing human eating behavior. This corresponds to: They highlight the complexity of human eating behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with using animal studies to explain human aggression?",
      "options": [
        "Animal studies are always more ethical",
        "Aggression in humans is influenced by cognitive factors",
        "Animal studies provide more accurate results",
        "Human aggression is simpler than animal aggression"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Human aggression involves cognitive factors that are not considered in animal studies, making it more complex and less directly comparable. This corresponds to: Aggression in humans is influenced by cognitive factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the SCN play in regulating behavior, as demonstrated by animal studies?",
      "options": [
        "It controls feeding behavior",
        "It regulates sleep/wake cycles",
        "It influences attachment behavior",
        "It affects social interactions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The SCN is crucial in regulating sleep/wake cycles, as shown in studies where its destruction led to the loss of these cycles in animals. This corresponds to: It regulates sleep/wake cycles."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key finding from the research on hormonal mechanisms in aggression in humans and other mammals?",
      "options": [
        "Hormonal mechanisms are identical in all species",
        "Aggression in humans is influenced solely by hormones",
        "Human aggression is more complex due to cognitive factors",
        "Animal aggression is less complex than human aggression"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Research indicates that while hormonal mechanisms are similar, human aggression is more complex due to the influence of cognitive factors. This corresponds to: Human aggression is more complex due to cognitive factors."
