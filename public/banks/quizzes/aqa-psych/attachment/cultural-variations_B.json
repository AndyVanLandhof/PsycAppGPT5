      "question": "In Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's 1988 meta-analysis, what was the most common type of attachment found across all cultures studied?",

        "Insecure-avoidant",
        "Insecure-resistant",
        "Secure",
        "Disorganized"

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Secure attachment was identified as the most common classification in every country examined"

      "question": "Which cultural group was found to have higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment according to Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg?",
      "options": [
        "Germany",
        "Japan",
        "USA",
        "UK"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Japan displayed higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment, indicating cultural differences in attachment styles"
    },
    {
      "question": "Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg found that the variation in attachment types within cultures was how many times greater than the variation between cultures?",
      "options": [
        "1.5 times",
        "2 times",
        "3 times",
        "4 times"

      "question": "An infant raised in a collectivist culture may display which type of attachment more frequently, according to cultural variations in attachment?",

        "Insecure-resistant",
        "Disorganized"

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Collectivist cultures, such as Japan and Israel, were found to have higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment"

    {
      "question": "If a study found that German children had the highest rates of insecure-avoidant attachment, what might this suggest about their childrearing practices?",
      "options": [
        "They are overly permissive.",
        "They encourage independence.",
        "They are neglectful.",
        "They are overly protective."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Higher rates of insecure-avoidant attachment may indicate that German childrearing practices encourage independence. This corresponds to: They encourage independence.."

    {
      "question": "One methodological issue with Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's meta-analysis is that the studies used the 'Strange Situation'. What is a potential limitation of this method?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks ecological validity.",
        "It is too simplistic.",
        "It is culturally biased.",
        "It requires extensive training."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The 'Strange Situation' may be culturally biased, as it was developed based on American/British norms. This corresponds to: It is culturally biased.."

      "question": "What conclusion can be drawn about secure attachment from the findings of Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's research?",
      "options": [
        "It is less common in collectivist cultures.",
        "It is the optimal form of attachment for healthy development.",
        "It varies significantly across cultures.",
        "It is only found in Western cultures."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The research supports the idea that secure attachment is the 'norm' and best for healthy social and emotional development. This corresponds to: It is the optimal form of attachment for healthy development.."

    {
      "question": "In the context of cultural variations, what does the term 'cultural relativism' imply?",
      "options": [
        "Behaviors should be judged based on universal standards.",
        "Behaviors cannot be judged without understanding the cultural context.",
        "All cultures have the same attachment styles.",
        "Attachment is solely determined by biological factors."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cultural relativism suggests that behaviors, including attachment styles, must be understood within their cultural context. This corresponds to: Behaviors cannot be judged without understanding the cultural context.."

      "question": "What does the continuity hypothesis suggest about securely attached infants?",
      "options": [
        "They will likely become insecure adults.",
        "They will have difficulty forming relationships.",
        "They will be emotionally secure and socially confident adults.",
        "They will not remember their early attachments."
