    {
      "question": "In Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's 1988 meta-analysis, which type of attachment was found to be the most common across all cultures studied?",
      "options": [
        "Insecure-resistant",
        "Insecure-avoidant",
        "Secure",
        "Disorganized"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Secure attachment was identified as the most common classification in every country examined"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which cultural group was found to have higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment according to Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's findings?",
      "options": [
        "American",
        "German",
        "Israeli",
        "British"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Japan and Israel, both collectivist cultures, displayed higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment. This corresponds to: Israeli."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a child is raised in a collectivist culture, which attachment style might they be more likely to exhibit according to cultural variations in attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Secure",
        "Insecure-avoidant",
        "Insecure-resistant",
        "Disorganized"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Children from collectivist cultures, such as Japan and Israel, are more likely to exhibit insecure-resistant attachment"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg conclude about the global pattern of attachment types?",
      "options": [
        "It varies significantly across cultures",
        "Secure attachment is the norm",
        "Insecure-avoidant is the most common",
        "Cultural practices have no impact"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "They concluded that secure attachment is the 'norm' and is the most common form of attachment across cultures. This corresponds to: Secure attachment is the norm."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg, how does intra-cultural variation compare to inter-cultural variation in attachment styles?",
      "options": [
        "It is less significant",
        "It is more significant",
        "It is equal",
        "It is irrelevant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Intra-cultural variation was found to be 1.5 times greater than variation between cultures. This corresponds to: It is more significant."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher is studying attachment styles in children from various cultures. They find that German children show higher rates of insecure-avoidant attachment. What might this indicate about cultural childrearing practices?",
      "options": [
        "They promote secure attachment",
        "They discourage independence",
        "They may emphasize self-reliance",
        "They have no impact on attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Higher rates of insecure-avoidant attachment in Germany may reflect cultural practices that emphasize self-reliance. This corresponds to: They may emphasize self-reliance."
    },
    {
      "question": "One methodological issue with Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's meta-analysis is that the studies used the Strange Situation. What is a potential limitation of this method?",
      "options": [
        "It is too subjective",
        "It may not represent all cultures accurately",
        "It lacks a control group",
        "It is too simplistic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Strange Situation may be biased towards American/British cultural norms, potentially misrepresenting other cultures. This corresponds to: It may not represent all cultures accurately."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the continuity hypothesis suggest about securely attached infants?",
      "options": [
        "They will develop insecure attachments later",
        "They will be socially confident adults",
        "They will struggle with relationships",
        "They will have no impact on adult relationships"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The continuity hypothesis posits that securely attached infants tend to become emotionally secure and socially confident adults. This corresponds to: They will be socially confident adults."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of cultural variations in attachment, what does cultural relativism imply?",
      "options": [
        "All cultures have the same attachment styles",
        "Attachment cannot be judged outside its cultural context",
        "Attachment is solely biological",
        "Cultural practices do not influence attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cultural relativism suggests that behavior, including attachment, must be understood within the cultural context in which it occurs. This corresponds to: Attachment cannot be judged outside its cultural context."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a child from a collectivist culture exhibits insecure-resistant attachment, what might this suggest about their early experiences?",
      "options": [
        "They were neglected",
        "They received inconsistent care",
        "They were overly independent",
        "They had no attachments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Insecure-resistant attachment may indicate that the child experienced inconsistent caregiving, common in collectivist cultures. This corresponds to: They received inconsistent care."
