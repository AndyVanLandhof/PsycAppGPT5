    {
      "question": "What was the primary aim of Ainsworth et al.'s Strange Situation (1971)?",
      "options": [
        "To assess the impact of separation on infants",
        "To identify different types of attachment",
        "To evaluate parenting styles",
        "To measure infant intelligence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Strange Situation was designed to systematically test the nature of attachment by observing infants' behavior under mild stress and novelty. This corresponds to: To identify different types of attachment."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Ainsworth's Strange Situation, which attachment type is characterized by a lack of response to separation and avoidance of the caregiver upon reunion?",
      "options": [
        "Secure attachment",
        "Insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Insecure-resistant attachment",
        "Insecure-disorganised attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Insecure-avoidant attachment is marked by minimal emotional response to separation and avoidance of the caregiver upon reunion"
    },
    {
      "question": "During the Strange Situation, Anna shows pleasure upon her mother's return and quickly resumes play. What attachment type does this behavior indicate?",

        "Insecure-avoidant",
        "Insecure-resistant",
        "Secure",
        "Insecure-disorganised"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Anna's behavior of being easily comforted and resuming exploration indicates a secure attachment type"

        "Secure",
        "Insecure-disorganised"

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Main and Solomon proposed the insecure-disorganised type D, characterized by inconsistent patterns of behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study of Japanese infants using the Strange Situation, what was a significant finding regarding attachment types?",
      "options": [
        "High rates of insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Similar rates of secure attachment to Ainsworth's findings",
        "Low rates of insecure-resistant attachment",
        "High rates of secure attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Takahashi found similar rates of secure attachment but no evidence of insecure-avoidant attachment among Japanese infants. This corresponds to: Similar rates of secure attachment to Ainsworth's findings."

    {
      "question": "Ainsworth et al. (1978) found almost perfect inter-observer reliability in their observations of exploratory behavior. What was the reliability coefficient reported?",

        "0.80",
        "0.90",
        "0.94",
        "1.00"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ainsworth et al. found a reliability coefficient of 0.94, indicating strong agreement among observers"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with Ainsworth's Strange Situation, particularly in relation to cultural differences?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of control over variables",
        "Imposed etic leading to cultural bias",
        "Observer bias affecting results",
        "Limited sample size"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Strange Situation has been criticized for being a culture-bound test, as it may not accurately reflect attachment styles in different cultures. This corresponds to: Imposed etic leading to cultural bias."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the Strange Situation, which attachment type is characterized by intense distress upon separation and conflicting behaviors upon reunion?",
      "options": [
        "Secure attachment",
        "Insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Insecure-resistant attachment",
        "Insecure-disorganised attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Insecure-resistant attachment is characterized by immediate distress upon separation and conflicting desires for contact upon reunion"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential limitation of the Strange Situation regarding its ecological validity?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks inter-observer reliability",
        "It is conducted in a controlled environment",
        "It does not consider long-term attachment",
        "It uses a diverse sample"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Strange Situation is conducted in a controlled environment, which may not reflect real-life attachment behaviors, thus limiting its ecological validity. This corresponds to: It is conducted in a controlled environment."

    {
