    {
      "question": "What is the main premise of Bowlby's monotropic theory of attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Attachment is learned through conditioning.",
        "Attachment is a biological instinct.",
        "Attachment is formed through social interactions.",
        "Attachment is solely based on feeding."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bowlby's monotropic theory posits that attachment is a biological instinct that has evolved to enhance the survival of the infant. This corresponds to: Attachment is a biological instinct.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Ainsworth's Strange Situation, which type of attachment is characterized by high levels of anxiety and resistance to comfort from the caregiver?",
      "options": [
        "Secure attachment",
        "Insecure-avoidant attachment",
        "Insecure-resistant attachment",
        "Disorganized attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Insecure-resistant attachment is marked by anxiety and ambivalence towards the caregiver, often resisting comfort"
    },
    {
      "question": "A study found that children raised in institutions showed significant emotional and social difficulties. This supports which of Bowlby's theories?",
      "options": [
        "Learning theory",
        "Maternal deprivation",
        "Monotropic theory",
        "Internal working model"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bowlby's theory of maternal deprivation suggests that prolonged separation from a primary caregiver can lead to emotional and social difficulties"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of the 'internal working model' in Bowlby's attachment theory?",
      "options": [
        "A model of attachment styles",
        "A framework for understanding future relationships",
        "A method for measuring attachment",
        "A theory of child development stages"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The internal working model refers to the mental representation of relationships formed through early attachments, influencing future relationships. This corresponds to: A framework for understanding future relationships."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing attachment styles across cultures, researchers found that Japanese children exhibited higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment. What does this suggest about cultural influences on attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Attachment styles are universal.",
        "Cultural practices shape attachment styles.",
        "Attachment is solely biological.",
        "All cultures value independence."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment in Japanese children suggest that cultural practices and values influence attachment styles. This corresponds to: Cultural practices shape attachment styles.."

    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often raised regarding Ainsworth's Strange Situation?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks ecological validity.",
        "It is too subjective.",
        "It does not account for cultural differences.",
        "It is not reliable."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the Strange Situation does not account for cultural differences, which may affect attachment behaviors and classifications. This corresponds to: It does not account for cultural differences.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the learning theory of attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Attachment is an innate behavior.",
        "Attachment is learned through reinforcement.",
        "Attachment is based on emotional bonds.",
        "Attachment is solely influenced by genetics."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The learning theory of attachment posits that attachment behaviors are learned through processes such as classical and operant conditioning. This corresponds to: Attachment is learned through reinforcement.."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher found that children who experienced sensitive caregiving were more likely to develop secure attachments. This supports which aspect of attachment theory?",
      "options": [
        "The critical period",
        "The internal working model",
        "Learning theory",
        "Bowlby's monotropic theory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This finding supports the idea of the internal working model, where sensitive caregiving leads to positive expectations in future relationships"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the learning theory of attachment?",
      "options": [
        "It ignores biological factors.",
        "It is too complex.",
        "It overemphasizes the role of genetics.",
        "It lacks empirical support."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A limitation of the learning theory is that it ignores biological factors, suggesting that attachment is solely learned rather than also influenced by innate processes. This corresponds to: It ignores biological factors.."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Bowlby, what is the significance of the 'critical period' in attachment?",
      "options": [
        "It is the time frame for learning attachment behaviors.",
        "It is the period when attachment is most likely to form.",
        "It is the age when children become independent.",
        "It is the time when maternal deprivation has no effect."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The critical period refers to the specific time frame in which attachments are most likely to form, typically within the first few years of life. This corresponds to: It is the period when attachment is most likely to form.."
