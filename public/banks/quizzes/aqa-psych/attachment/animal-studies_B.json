    {
      "question": "What did Harlow's study (1958) with rhesus monkeys demonstrate about attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Monkeys preferred the wire mother that fed them",
        "Monkeys preferred the cloth mother for comfort",
        "Monkeys formed attachments based solely on food",
        "Monkeys showed no preference for either mother"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Harlow's study showed that monkeys preferred the cloth mother for comfort over the wire mother that provided food, indicating that attachment is not solely based on feeding"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Lorenz's study (1935), what was the main finding regarding imprinting in goslings?",
      "options": [
        "Goslings imprinted on their biological mother",
        "Goslings imprinted on the first moving object they saw",
        "Goslings did not imprint at all",
        "Goslings preferred stationary objects"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Lorenz found that goslings imprinted on the first moving object they encountered, demonstrating the concept of imprinting in attachment. This corresponds to: Goslings imprinted on the first moving object they saw."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a criticism of using animal studies to understand human attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Animal studies provide clear evidence for human attachment",
        "Humans have more complex attachment behaviors than animals",
        "Animal studies are ethically sound",
        "Animal behavior is identical to human behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A key criticism is that human attachment behaviors are more complex and involve conscious decisions, which cannot be fully understood through animal studies. This corresponds to: Humans have more complex attachment behaviors than animals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ethical concern is raised by Harlow's study on attachment in monkeys?",
      "options": [
        "The study had no significant findings",
        "The monkeys experienced lasting emotional harm",
        "The study was conducted without proper controls",
        "The monkeys were not observed long enough"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Harlow's study raised ethical concerns as it caused lasting emotional harm to the monkeys, affecting their ability to form relationships later in life. This corresponds to: The monkeys experienced lasting emotional harm."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do animal studies contribute to our understanding of attachment, according to the AQA materials?",
      "options": [
        "They provide definitive answers about human attachment",
        "They highlight the differences between human and animal behavior",
        "They serve as a useful pointer but require human confirmation",
        "They are irrelevant to human attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Animal studies can act as useful pointers in understanding attachment, but findings must be confirmed by research involving humans. This corresponds to: They serve as a useful pointer but require human confirmation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Schaffer and Emerson's findings support regarding attachment in infants?",
      "options": [
        "Infants are most attached to the person who feeds them",
        "Infants form attachments based on comfort and security",
        "Infants do not form attachments at all",
        "Infants only attach to their biological mothers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Schaffer and Emerson found that infants were not most attached to the person who fed them, supporting the idea that attachment is based on comfort and security. This corresponds to: Infants form attachments based on comfort and security."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with using animal studies in attachment research?",
      "options": [
        "Animal studies are always ethically sound",
        "Animal behavior can be generalized to humans without caution",
        "Animal studies often lack ecological validity",
        "Animal studies provide comprehensive insights into human emotions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A methodological issue is that animal studies often lack ecological validity, as the conditions in which animals are studied may not reflect real-world scenarios"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the concept of imprinting play in understanding attachment, as demonstrated by Lorenz?",
      "options": [
        "Imprinting is irrelevant to attachment",
        "Imprinting occurs only in humans",
        "Imprinting is a critical process for forming attachments in certain species",
        "Imprinting is a learned behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Lorenz's work on imprinting highlighted that it is a critical process for forming attachments in certain species, such as birds. This corresponds to: Imprinting is a critical process for forming attachments in certain species."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the limitations of behaviorist explanations of attachment?",
      "options": [
        "They account for all aspects of human behavior",
        "They ignore cognitive and emotional factors",
        "They are based solely on human studies",
        "They are universally accepted without criticism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Behaviorist explanations of attachment are limited as they ignore cognitive and emotional factors, presenting an oversimplified view of human behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Harlow's study reveal about the importance of comfort in attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Comfort is irrelevant to attachment",
        "Comfort is secondary to feeding",
        "Comfort is a primary factor in forming attachments",
        "Comfort is only important in human attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Harlow's study revealed that comfort is a primary factor in forming attachments, as the monkeys preferred the cloth mother over the wire mother that provided food"
