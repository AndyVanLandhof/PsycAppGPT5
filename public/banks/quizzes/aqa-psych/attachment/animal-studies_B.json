    {
      "question": "What was the primary finding of Harlow's study on attachment in rhesus monkeys (1958)?",
      "options": [
        "Monkeys preferred the wire mother that fed them",
        "Monkeys showed no preference for either mother",
        "Monkeys preferred the cloth mother for comfort",
        "Monkeys formed attachments based solely on food"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Harlow found that monkeys preferred the cloth mother for comfort over the wire mother that provided food"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Schaffer and Emerson's study (1964), what did they find regarding infant attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Infants were most attached to the person who fed them",
        "Infants showed attachment to multiple caregivers",
        "Infants were primarily attached to their fathers",
        "Infants did not form attachments at all"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Schaffer and Emerson found that infants were not most attached to the person who fed them, indicating that attachment is not solely based on feeding. This corresponds to: Infants showed attachment to multiple caregivers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ethical concern arises from Harlow's study on attachment in monkeys?",
      "options": [
        "The study caused no harm to the monkeys",
        "The monkeys were not observed in their natural habitat",
        "The study created lasting emotional harm to the monkeys",
        "The study was conducted without proper consent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Harlow's study is criticized for causing lasting emotional harm, as the monkeys later struggled to form relationships with peers. This corresponds to: The study created lasting emotional harm to the monkeys."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with using animal studies to understand human attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Animal studies provide a complete understanding of human behavior",
        "Humans and animals are inherently different in moral and cognitive aspects",
        "Animal studies are always ethically sound",
        "Animal behavior is identical to human behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A methodological issue is that humans and animals differ significantly in moral and cognitive aspects, which limits the generalizability of animal studies to human attachment. This corresponds to: Humans and animals are inherently different in moral and cognitive aspects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Lorenz's study on imprinting in geese (1935) demonstrate about attachment?",
      "options": [
        "Imprinting occurs only in mammals",
        "Attachments can form without a critical period",
        "Geese will imprint on any moving object",
        "Imprinting is a learned behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Lorenz demonstrated that geese imprint on the first moving object they encounter, typically their mother, highlighting the importance of a critical period. This corresponds to: Geese will imprint on any moving object."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do animal studies contribute to our understanding of human attachment according to the AQA materials?",
      "options": [
        "They provide definitive conclusions applicable to humans",
        "They serve as useful pointers but require human confirmation",
        "They are irrelevant to human attachment",
        "They show that attachment is solely based on feeding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Animal studies can provide insights into attachment processes, but findings must be confirmed through research involving humans. This corresponds to: They serve as useful pointers but require human confirmation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of learning theory in explaining human attachment?",
      "options": [
        "It considers cognitive factors in attachment",
        "It is based on studies with non-human animals",
        "It includes emotional aspects of attachment",
        "It is universally accepted among psychologists"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A limitation of learning theory is that it is largely based on studies with non-human animals, which may not fully capture the complexities of human attachment. This corresponds to: It is based on studies with non-human animals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the SCN play in attachment behavior according to animal studies?",
      "options": [
        "It regulates feeding behavior",
        "It influences sleep/wake cycles",
        "It has no relevance to attachment",
        "It is solely responsible for emotional bonding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The SCN is involved in regulating sleep/wake cycles, which can indirectly affect attachment behaviors through overall health and well-being. This corresponds to: It influences sleep/wake cycles."
    },
    {
      "question": "What finding did DeCoursey et al. (2000) reveal about the SCN in chipmunks?",
      "options": [
        "SCN destruction had no effect on behavior",
        "Chipmunks became more social after SCN destruction",
        "Chipmunks lost their sleep/wake cycle and became vulnerable",
        "SCN is irrelevant to animal behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "DeCoursey et al. found that destroying the SCN connections in chipmunks led to the disappearance of their sleep/wake cycle, making them vulnerable to predators. This corresponds to: Chipmunks lost their sleep/wake cycle and became vulnerable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key difference between human and animal attachment behaviors?",
      "options": [
        "Human attachment is solely based on conditioning",
        "Animal attachment is more complex than human attachment",
        "Human attachment involves cognitive factors not present in animals",
        "Animal attachment is influenced by social factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Human attachment behaviors are influenced by cognitive factors, making them more complex than the attachment behaviors observed in animals. This corresponds to: Human attachment involves cognitive factors not present in animals."
