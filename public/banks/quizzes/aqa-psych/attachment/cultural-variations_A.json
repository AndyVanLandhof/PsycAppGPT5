    {
      "question": "In Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's meta-analysis (1988), which type of attachment was found to be the most common across all cultures studied?",
      "options": [
        "Insecure-resistant",
        "Insecure-avoidant",
        "Secure",
        "Disorganized"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Secure attachment was identified as the most common classification in every country examined"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which cultural group was found to have higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment according to Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's findings?",
      "options": [
        "American",
        "German",
        "Japanese",
        "British"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Japan, classified as a collectivist culture, displayed higher levels of insecure-resistant attachment. This corresponds to: Japanese."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a child from Germany exhibits higher levels of insecure-avoidant attachment, what might this reflect about the cultural childrearing practices?",
      "options": [
        "More nurturing practices",
        "Less emotional availability",
        "Higher levels of maternal deprivation",
        "More collectivist values"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The higher levels of insecure-avoidant attachment in Germany may reflect less emotional availability in childrearing practices"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg conclude about the global pattern of attachment types?",
      "options": [
        "It varies significantly by culture",
        "It is predominantly insecure",
        "It supports the idea of innate attachment",
        "It is influenced solely by environmental factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "They concluded that the global pattern supports the idea that secure attachment is innate and biologically determined. This corresponds to: It supports the idea of innate attachment."

    {
      "question": "What was a significant finding regarding intra-cultural differences in attachment from Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg's research?",
      "options": [
        "They were less than inter-cultural differences",
        "They were equal to inter-cultural differences",
        "They were more than inter-cultural differences",
        "They were non-existent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The variation within cultures was found to be 1.5 times greater than the variation between cultures. This corresponds to: They were more than inter-cultural differences."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a child from a collectivist culture shows a strong attachment to their mother, what might this suggest about the nature of attachment in that culture?",
      "options": [
        "Attachment is not important",
        "Attachment is biologically determined",
        "Attachment varies significantly",
        "Attachment is solely based on individual experiences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This suggests that attachment may be biologically determined, as secure attachment is common across cultures. This corresponds to: Attachment is biologically determined."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue did Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg face in their meta-analysis of attachment studies?",
      "options": [
        "Small sample sizes",
        "Use of the Strange Situation",
        "Lack of cultural representation",
        "Inconsistent definitions of attachment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The use of the Strange Situation may have biased the findings towards American/British cultural norms"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which cultural practice might explain the higher rates of insecure-avoidant attachment found in Germany?",
      "options": [
        "Close physical contact",
        "Encouragement of independence",
        "Emphasis on emotional expression",
        "Collectivist parenting styles"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The emphasis on encouraging independence in German childrearing may lead to higher rates of insecure-avoidant attachment. This corresponds to: Encouragement of independence."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of cultural variations in attachment, what does the term 'cultural relativism' imply?",
      "options": [
        "All cultures have the same attachment styles",
        "Attachment styles are universal",
        "Behaviors must be understood within their cultural context",
        "Attachment is solely determined by biology"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Cultural relativism suggests that behaviors, including attachment styles, cannot be judged without considering the cultural context. This corresponds to: Behaviors must be understood within their cultural context."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The continuity hypothesis posits that securely attached infants are likely to become emotionally secure and socially confident adults. This corresponds to: They will develop trust and confidence as adults."
