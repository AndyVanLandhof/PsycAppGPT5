      "question": "In Nemeth and Brilmayer's (1987) study, what factor was found to enhance the effectiveness of a minority influence in a jury situation?",
      "options": [
        "Consistency",
        "Flexibility",
        "Commitment",
        "Majority support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The study found that a confederate who showed flexibility by compromising had a greater influence on the group compared to one who remained rigid"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Wood et al. (1994), what characteristic of minorities is most influential in changing majority opinions?",
      "options": [
        "Flexibility",
        "Commitment",
        "Consistency",
        "Visibility"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Wood et al. found that minorities who were especially consistent were the most influential in changing majority opinions. This corresponds to: Consistency."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a minority group advocates for environmental policies, what process might lead to the majority adopting these views?",
      "options": [
        "Compliance",
        "Internalisation",
        "Identification",
        "Conformity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The majority may internalise the minority's views after scrutinising their arguments, leading to a deeper acceptance of the new position. This corresponds to: Internalisation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'snowball effect' in the context of minority influence?",
      "options": [
        "A gradual increase in minority numbers",
        "A sudden shift in majority opinion",
        "A decrease in dissenting views",
        "An increase in conformity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The snowball effect refers to a tipping point where a small percentage of committed minority opinion holders can lead to a significant shift in majority views. This corresponds to: A sudden shift in majority opinion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Mackie (1987) argues that the majority's views lead to greater processing of information. What is the implication of this for minority influence?",
      "options": [
        "Minorities are always more persuasive",
        "Majorities are less likely to consider minority views",
        "Minorities must be more consistent",
        "Majorities ignore dissenting opinions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mackie's argument suggests that the majority's differing views prompt more careful consideration, potentially undermining the influence of minorities. This corresponds to: Majorities are less likely to consider minority views."

    {
      "question": "What challenge do minorities face when trying to influence the majority, as highlighted in the AQA materials?",
      "options": [
        "Being perceived as deviant",
        "Lack of visibility",
        "Insufficient numbers",
        "Inconsistent messaging"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Minorities are often seen as deviant, which limits their influence as the majority may avoid aligning with them to not appear deviant themselves. This corresponds to: Being perceived as deviant."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Xie et al. (2011) discover about the necessary percentage of committed individuals needed to influence the majority?",
      "options": [
        "5%",
        "10%",
        "15%",
        "20%"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Xie et al. found that just 10% of committed individuals could 'tip' the majority into accepting the minority position"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of social cryptomnesia relate to social change?",
      "options": [
        "People forget the origins of majority views",
        "Majorities resist change",
        "Minorities are always remembered",
        "Dissent is quickly forgotten"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Social cryptomnesia occurs when people forget that the current majority view was once a minority position, illustrating how social change can be normalized over time. This corresponds to: People forget the origins of majority views."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue associated with studying minority influence, as discussed in the AQA materials?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of real-world application",
        "Overemphasis on laboratory settings",
        "Insufficient sample sizes",
        "Inconsistent definitions of minority"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Many studies on minority influence are conducted in laboratory settings, which may not accurately reflect real-world dynamics of social influence. This corresponds to: Overemphasis on laboratory settings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does commitment play in minority influence according to the AQA materials?",
      "options": [
        "It leads to immediate compliance",
        "It enhances the perceived legitimacy of the minority",
        "It is irrelevant to the process",
        "It creates a sense of urgency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Commitment is crucial as it enhances the perceived legitimacy of the minority's position, making it more likely for the majority to consider their views"
