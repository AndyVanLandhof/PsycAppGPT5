        "Proximity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Wood et al. found that minorities who were especially consistent were most influential, highlighting the importance of consistency. This corresponds to: Flexibility."

    {
      "question": "In Nemeth and Brilmayer's (1987) study, what was the effect of a confederate who showed flexibility during discussions?",

    },
    {
      "question": "DeJong et al. (2009) found that social norms marketing campaigns did not reduce alcohol consumption among students. What does this suggest about social norms interventions?",
      "options": [
        "They are always effective",
        "They can sometimes fail to produce change",
        "They only work in certain demographics",
        "They are more effective than minority influence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The findings suggest that not all social norms interventions are capable of producing social change, indicating limitations in their effectiveness. This corresponds to: They can sometimes fail to produce change."
