      "question": "A student feels pressured to agree with their friends' opinions on a movie, even though they did not enjoy it. This is an example of which type of conformity?",

        "It is always negative",
        "It is influenced by task difficulty",
        "It is unrelated to group dynamics",
        "It is a sign of weakness"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This suggests that task difficulty can increase conformity as individuals may look to others for guidance when uncertain. This corresponds to: It is influenced by task difficulty."

    {
      "question": "A participant in a study conforms to a group's answer on a difficult task because they believe the group knows better. This is an example of which type of influence?",

        "Compliance",
        "Identification"
