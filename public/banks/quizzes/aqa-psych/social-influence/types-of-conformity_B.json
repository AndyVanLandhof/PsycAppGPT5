    {
      "question": "Kelman (1958) identified three types of conformity. Which of the following is NOT one of those types?",
      "options": [
        "Internalisation",
        "Identification",
        "Compliance",
        "Obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Obedience is not one of the types of conformity identified by Kelman; the three types are internalisation, identification, and compliance"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Asch's (1951) study on conformity, which variable was found to significantly affect conformity rates?",
      "options": [
        "Group size",
        "Gender of participants",
        "Age of participants",
        "Cultural background"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Asch found that group size significantly affected conformity rates, with larger groups leading to higher conformity"
    },
    {
      "question": "A student conforms to a group opinion because they want to be accepted by their peers. This is an example of which type of conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Internalisation",
        "Identification",
        "Compliance",
        "Obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates identification, where the individual adopts the group's attitudes to be accepted"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, participants were more likely to conform when the task was difficult rather than easy. What does this suggest about the reasons for conformity?",
      "options": [
        "People conform to fit in",
        "People conform due to uncertainty",
        "People do not conform under pressure",
        "People conform to gain knowledge"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This suggests that uncertainty in difficult tasks leads individuals to conform, believing others may have more accurate information. This corresponds to: People conform due to uncertainty."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which explanation for conformity suggests that individuals conform to be correct in ambiguous situations?",
      "options": [
        "Normative social influence",
        "Informational social influence",
        "Identification",
        "Compliance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Informational social influence explains conformity as a desire to be correct, especially in ambiguous situations"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that conformity rates decrease when one other person in the group gives the correct answer. This illustrates the impact of which variable?",
      "options": [
        "Group size",
        "Unanimity",
        "Task difficulty",
        "Cultural background"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario highlights the importance of unanimity, as having one dissenting voice can reduce conformity"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with Asch's conformity study?",
      "options": [
        "It lacked ecological validity",
        "It was conducted in a natural setting",
        "It included a diverse sample",
        "It used a longitudinal design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Asch's study lacked ecological validity as it was conducted in a lab setting, which may not reflect real-life situations. This corresponds to: It lacked ecological validity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of conformity involves accepting the group's beliefs as true and adopting them internally?",
      "options": [
        "Compliance",
        "Identification",
        "Internalisation",
        "Obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Internalisation occurs when individuals accept the group's beliefs as true and integrate them into their own value system"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a person changes their behavior to match a group but does not change their beliefs, what type of conformity is this?",
      "options": [
        "Internalisation",
        "Identification",
        "Compliance",
        "Obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario describes compliance, where behavior changes to fit in, but personal beliefs remain unchanged"
    },
    {
      "question": "Research suggests that women may conform more than men in certain contexts. What does this imply about gender and conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Conformity is universal across genders",
        "Men are always more conformist",
        "Conformity can vary based on the task",
        "Gender has no impact on conformity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This implies that conformity can vary based on the context of the task, as suggested by Eagly and Carli (1981). This corresponds to: Conformity can vary based on the task."
