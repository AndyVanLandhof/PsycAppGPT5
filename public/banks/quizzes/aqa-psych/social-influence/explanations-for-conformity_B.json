    {
      "question": "In Asch's 1956 study, what was the primary reason participants conformed to the incorrect majority answer?",
      "options": [
        "To gain social approval",
        "To avoid punishment",
        "To express their true beliefs",
        "To demonstrate independence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Participants conformed primarily due to normative social influence, seeking social approval from the group. This corresponds to: To gain social approval."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Asch's findings, how did increasing the size of the majority affect conformity rates?",
      "options": [
        "It decreased conformity",
        "It had no effect",
        "It increased conformity",
        "It caused confusion among participants"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Asch found that increasing the size of the majority led to higher rates of conformity among participants. This corresponds to: It increased conformity."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a participant is influenced by a group to answer incorrectly, which type of conformity is most likely occurring?",
      "options": [
        "Internalisation",
        "Identification",
        "Compliance",
        "Social facilitation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates compliance, where the participant conforms publicly but may not privately agree with the group's answer"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a participant in Asch's study had an ally who provided the correct answer, what was the effect on conformity levels?",
      "options": [
        "Conformity increased",
        "Conformity decreased",
        "Conformity remained unchanged",
        "Conformity became unpredictable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of an ally who also gave the correct answer significantly reduced conformity levels from 33% to 5.5%. This corresponds to: Conformity decreased."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between normative social influence and informational social influence?",
      "options": [
        "Normative is about group acceptance; informational is about seeking correct information",
        "Normative is always public; informational is always private",
        "Normative leads to internalisation; informational leads to compliance",
        "Normative is based on personal beliefs; informational is based on group beliefs"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Normative social influence is driven by the desire for acceptance, while informational social influence occurs when individuals seek accurate information. This corresponds to: Normative is about group acceptance; informational is about seeking correct information."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study where participants were asked to judge the length of lines, what effect did task difficulty have on conformity according to Asch?",
      "options": [
        "It decreased conformity",
        "It increased conformity",
        "It had no effect",
        "It caused confusion among participants"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Asch found that as task difficulty increased, conformity rates also increased, suggesting that uncertainty leads to greater reliance on the group. This corresponds to: It increased conformity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of social support influence an individual's likelihood to conform?",
      "options": [
        "It increases conformity",
        "It decreases conformity",
        "It has no effect",
        "It creates confusion about the correct answer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social support from an ally who provides the correct answer can significantly decrease conformity by breaking the majority's unanimity. This corresponds to: It decreases conformity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes internalisation in the context of conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Publicly conforming while privately disagreeing",
        "Changing beliefs to align with the group",
        "Following orders from an authority figure",
        "Adopting a group's norms temporarily"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Internalisation involves a genuine change in beliefs to align with the group, resulting in private acceptance of the group's views. This corresponds to: Changing beliefs to align with the group."

      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with Asch's conformity study?",
      "options": [
        "It lacked ecological validity",
        "It was too complex for participants",
        "It had a small sample size",
        "It did not measure individual differences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Asch's study is often criticized for lacking ecological validity, as the artificial setting may not reflect real-world conformity situations. This corresponds to: It lacked ecological validity."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Smith et al. (2006), how do conformity rates differ between individualist and collectivist cultures?",
      "options": [
        "Collectivist cultures show lower conformity",
        "Individualist cultures show higher conformity",
        "Collectivist cultures show higher conformity",
        "There is no difference in conformity rates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Smith et al. found that collectivist cultures had higher average conformity rates (37%) compared to individualist cultures (25%). This corresponds to: Collectivist cultures show higher conformity."
