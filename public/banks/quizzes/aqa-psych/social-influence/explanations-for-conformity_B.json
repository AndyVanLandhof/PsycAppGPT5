    {
      "question": "In Asch's 1956 study, what was the primary reason participants conformed to the incorrect majority answer?",
      "options": [
        "To gain accurate information",
        "To avoid standing out",
        "To demonstrate independence",
        "To challenge authority"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Participants conformed primarily due to normative social influence, which is the desire to fit in and avoid being the odd one out. This corresponds to: To avoid standing out."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Asch's findings, how did group size affect conformity rates?",
      "options": [
        "Conformity decreased with larger groups",
        "Conformity increased with larger groups",
        "Group size had no effect",
        "Conformity was highest in groups of two"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Asch found that increasing the size of the majority led to an increase in conformity rates. This corresponds to: Conformity increased with larger groups."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a participant is given the correct answer by an ally in Asch's study, what effect does this have on conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Increases conformity",
        "Decreases conformity",
        "Has no effect",
        "Increases uncertainty"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of an ally who also gives the correct answer reduces conformity from 33% to 5.5%, as it breaks the unanimity of the majority. This corresponds to: Decreases conformity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between compliance and internalisation in terms of conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Compliance involves private acceptance, internalisation does not",
        "Internalisation involves private acceptance, compliance does not",
        "Both involve public agreement",
        "Neither involves any change in behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Internalisation involves private acceptance of the group's beliefs, while compliance is a superficial change in behavior without internal agreement. This corresponds to: Internalisation involves private acceptance, compliance does not."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of conformity, what does the term 'unanimity' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The agreement of all group members",
        "The presence of dissenters",
        "The size of the majority",
        "The difficulty of the task"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Unanimity refers to the agreement of all group members, which significantly increases conformity levels"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of social support influence an individual's likelihood to conform, as demonstrated in Asch's study?",
      "options": [
        "It increases conformity",
        "It has no effect",
        "It decreases conformity",
        "It only affects task difficulty"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The presence of social support from an ally reduces conformity by providing an independent assessment of reality. This corresponds to: It decreases conformity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of Asch's study regarding the generalizability of its findings?",
      "options": [
        "It used a diverse sample",
        "It was conducted in a natural setting",
        "It primarily involved male participants",
        "It had a high ecological validity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Asch's study primarily involved male participants, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other genders. This corresponds to: It primarily involved male participants."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of social influence is most likely to lead to internalisation?",
      "options": [
        "Normative social influence",
        "Informational social influence",
        "Compliance",
        "Social support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Informational social influence leads to internalisation as individuals seek accurate information and adopt the group's beliefs"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study where participants are asked to judge the length of lines, what effect does task difficulty have on conformity according to Asch's findings?",
      "options": [
        "Increases conformity",
        "Decreases conformity",
        "Has no effect",
        "Only affects compliance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Asch found that increasing task difficulty led to an increase in conformity, as individuals were less confident in their judgments. This corresponds to: Increases conformity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of 'locus of control' relate to resistance to conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Individuals with an internal locus are less likely to resist",
        "Individuals with an external locus are more likely to resist",
        "Individuals with an internal locus are more likely to resist",
        "Locus of control has no effect on conformity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Individuals with an internal locus of control believe they can influence their circumstances, making them more resistant to social influence. This corresponds to: Individuals with an internal locus are more likely to resist."
