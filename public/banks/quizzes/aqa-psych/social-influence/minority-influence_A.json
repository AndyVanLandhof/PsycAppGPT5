    {
      "question": "Which of the following factors is essential for minority influence to be effective, according to Wood et al. (1994)?",
      "options": [
        "Consistency",
        "Flexibility",
        "Commitment",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Wood et al. (1994) found that minorities who were especially consistent were most influential, highlighting the importance of consistency, commitment, and flexibility. This corresponds to: All of the above."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Nemeth and Brilmayer's (1987) study, what was the effect of a confederate who showed flexibility during discussions?",
      "options": [
        "No influence",
        "Increased influence",
        "Decreased influence",
        "Immediate acceptance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The confederate who compromised and showed flexibility exerted influence on the rest of the group, unlike those who remained rigid. This corresponds to: Increased influence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'snowball effect' in the context of minority influence as described by Xie et al. (2011)?",
      "options": [
        "A gradual increase in majority support",
        "A sudden shift in opinion after reaching a tipping point",
        "The initial resistance to minority views",
        "The process of internalising minority beliefs"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Xie et al. (2011) discovered that once a minority reaches about 10% of the population, it can lead to a sudden shift in majority opinion, known as the snowball effect. This corresponds to: A sudden shift in opinion after reaching a tipping point."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a minority group advocates for environmental policies, what might limit their influence according to the materials?",
      "options": [
        "High levels of commitment",
        "Perceived deviance from the majority",
        "Flexibility in arguments",
        "Consistent messaging"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Minorities may be seen as 'deviant' by the majority, which can limit their influence as the majority may avoid aligning with them to not appear deviant. This corresponds to: Perceived deviance from the majority."
    },
    {
      "question": "DeJong et al. (2009) tested social norms marketing campaigns but found that students did not report lower alcohol consumption. What does this suggest about social norms interventions?",
      "options": [
        "They are always effective",
        "They can have limitations",
        "They are only effective with minorities",
        "They require majority support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The findings suggest that not all social norms interventions are able to produce social change, indicating limitations in their effectiveness. This corresponds to: They can have limitations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Mackie (1987) argue about the processing of minority messages compared to majority messages?",
      "options": [
        "Minority messages are processed more deeply",
        "Majority messages are ignored",
        "Majority messages lead to greater processing",
        "Minority messages are always persuasive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Mackie (1987) argues that the majority creates greater message processing because individuals feel the need to understand differing views from the majority. This corresponds to: Majority messages lead to greater processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue highlighted by Nemeth (2010) regarding the acceptance of dissenting views?",
      "options": [
        "Dissent is always welcomed",
        "Dissent leads to group harmony",
        "People may appear tolerant but become irritated by persistent dissent",
        "Dissent is always effective"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Nemeth (2010) claims that while people may accept the principle of dissent, they often become irritated by dissenting views that persist, which can hinder effective influence. This corresponds to: People may appear tolerant but become irritated by persistent dissent."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the materials, what is a key characteristic of the conversion process in minority influence?",
      "options": [
        "Superficial agreement",
        "Internalisation of the minority's viewpoint",
        "Immediate compliance",
        "Majority dominance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The conversion process involves individuals scrutinising the minority's message, leading to a deeper and longer-lasting internalisation of their viewpoint. This corresponds to: Internalisation of the minority's viewpoint."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does flexibility play in minority influence, based on Nemeth and Brilmayer's (1987) findings?",
      "options": [
        "It is ineffective",
        "It can enhance influence if shown at the right time",
        "It always leads to majority acceptance",
        "It is less important than consistency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Nemeth and Brilmayer (1987) found that flexibility can enhance influence, particularly when shown later in negotiations, rather than appearing to 'cave in' early. This corresponds to: It can enhance influence if shown at the right time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is social cryptomnesia in the context of social change?",
      "options": [
        "Forgetting the origins of a social norm",
        "Remembering the minority's influence",
        "Recognising the majority's past beliefs",
        "Internalising minority views"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Social cryptomnesia occurs when individuals forget that the current majority view was once a minority position, illustrating how social change can be perceived over time. This corresponds to: Forgetting the origins of a social norm."
