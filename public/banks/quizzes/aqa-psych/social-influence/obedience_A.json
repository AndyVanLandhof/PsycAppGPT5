    {
      "question": "In Milgram's study (1963), what percentage of participants administered the maximum shock of 450V when the experimenter was present in the same room?",
      "options": [
        "35%",
        "65%",
        "48%",
        "10%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Milgram found that 65% of participants obeyed to the maximum shock level when the experimenter was in the same room"

    {
      "question": "According to Tarnow's study (2000) on aviation accidents, what was a significant factor contributing to crashes?",
      "options": [
        "Excessive crew training",
        "Lack of monitoring errors",
        "Poor weather conditions",
        "Pilot fatigue"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tarnow found that excessive dependence on the captain's authority led to lack of monitoring errors in many accidents"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a variation of Milgram's study, when participants were joined by two disobedient confederates, what was the effect on obedience levels?",
      "options": [
        "Obedience levels increased",
        "Obedience levels decreased",
        "Obedience levels remained the same",
        "Obedience levels doubled"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of disobedient peers can liberate participants from the pressure to obey, leading to decreased obedience. This corresponds to: Obedience levels decreased."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one factor that has been shown to decrease obedience in Milgram's experiments?",
      "options": [
        "Proximity to authority",
        "Presence of disobedient peers",
        "High status of the location",
        "Clear instructions from authority"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Milgram's variations showed that having disobedient peers significantly decreased obedience levels. This corresponds to: Presence of disobedient peers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the term 'legitimacy of authority' refer to in the context of obedience?",
      "options": [
        "The moral justification for disobedience",
        "The perceived right of an authority figure to give orders",
        "The ability to resist authority",
        "The influence of peer pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Legitimacy of authority refers to the perception that an authority figure has the right to issue commands, which can lead to higher obedience. This corresponds to: The perceived right of an authority figure to give orders."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of obedience, how does the agentic state explain why individuals follow orders?",
      "options": [
        "They feel personally responsible for their actions",
        "They believe they are acting on behalf of an authority figure",
        "They are motivated by social approval",
        "They fear punishment for disobedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The agentic state suggests that individuals see themselves as agents executing the wishes of an authority figure, thus feeling less personal responsibility. This corresponds to: They believe they are acting on behalf of an authority figure."

    {
      "question": "What was the finding of Elms and Milgram's study regarding the Authoritarian Personality?",
      "options": [
        "No correlation with obedience",
        "Higher F scale scores in obedient participants",
        "Lower F scale scores in obedient participants",
        "Equal F scale scores across all participants"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Elms and Milgram found that participants who were obedient in Milgram's study scored higher on the F scale, indicating a relationship between Authoritarian Personality and obedience. This corresponds to: Higher F scale scores in obedient participants."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the situational context of Milgram's study affect the generalizability of its findings?",
      "options": [
        "It supports the idea that personality traits are the main cause of obedience",
        "It suggests that obedience is easier to achieve in real-life situations",
        "It indicates that laboratory settings may not reflect real-life obedience",
        "It shows that obedience is solely based on individual differences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The laboratory setting of Milgram's study may not accurately reflect real-life situations, where obedience can be more complex and influenced by various factors. This corresponds to: It indicates that laboratory settings may not reflect real-life obedience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does education level play in obedience according to Milgram's findings?",
      "options": [
        "Higher education leads to more obedience",
        "Lower education leads to more obedience",

        "Unrealistic setting"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics often highlight the use of deception in Milgram's study, which raises ethical concerns about the treatment of participants"
