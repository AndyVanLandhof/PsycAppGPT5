    {
      "question": "In Milgram's 1963 study on obedience, what percentage of participants administered the maximum shock of 450V when the experimenter was present in the same room?",
      "options": [
        "35%",
        "65%",
        "48%",
        "10%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Milgram found that 65% of participants administered the maximum shock when the experimenter was present"
    },
    {
      "question": "Tarnow's 2000 study on aviation accidents highlighted the dangers of excessive dependence on authority. What was the main finding regarding crew actions?",
      "options": [
        "Crew members ignored authority",
        "Crew members followed orders without question",
        "Crew members acted independently",
        "Crew members were trained to question authority"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tarnow found that excessive dependence on the captain's authority contributed to errors in 19 of the 37 accidents studied. This corresponds to: Crew members followed orders without question."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to research, which factor is likely to decrease obedience?",
      "options": [
        "Presence of a legitimate authority figure",
        "Proximity to the victim",
        "Having disobedient peers",
        "High educational level"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Research shows that individuals are more confident in resisting obedience when they have disobedient peers as role models. This corresponds to: Having disobedient peers."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Milgram's variations, what effect did the presence of two disobedient confederates have on the participant's obedience levels?",
      "options": [
        "Increased obedience",
        "Decreased obedience",
        "No effect",
        "Varied by participant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When participants were with two disobedient confederates, obedience levels significantly decreased. This corresponds to: Decreased obedience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the term 'agentic state' refer to in the context of obedience?",
      "options": [
        "A state of independence",
        "A state of moral responsibility",
        "A state of unquestioning obedience",
        "A state of rebellion against authority"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The agentic state describes a condition where individuals see themselves as agents executing another person's wishes, thus feeling less responsible for their actions. This corresponds to: A state of unquestioning obedience."

      "question": "How does the legitimacy of authority influence obedience, according to Milgram's findings?",
      "options": [
        "It has no effect",
        "It increases the likelihood of disobedience",
        "It decreases the likelihood of obedience",
        "It increases the likelihood of obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Milgram's research suggests that individuals are more likely to obey when they perceive the authority figure as legitimate. This corresponds to: It increases the likelihood of obedience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is raised by Fromm regarding Milgram's study of obedience?",
      "options": [
        "The sample was too diverse",
        "The setting was too artificial",
        "The participants were not informed",
        "The results were not replicable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Fromm argued that the laboratory setting made participants more likely to obey, which may not reflect real-life obedience. This corresponds to: The setting was too artificial."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does education level play in obedience, based on findings from Milgram's study?",
      "options": [
        "Higher education leads to more obedience",
        "Lower education leads to more obedience",
        "Education has no effect",
        "Education decreases obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Milgram found that participants with lower levels of education tended to be more obedient than those with higher levels. This corresponds to: Lower education leads to more obedience."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of obedience, what does the term 'right-wing authoritarianism' suggest about political beliefs?",
      "options": [
        "Left-wing individuals are more obedient",
        "Right-wing individuals are more obedient",

        "All political beliefs lead to equal obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Altemeyer's concept of right-wing authoritarianism suggests that individuals identifying as right-wing are more likely to obey authority. This corresponds to: Right-wing individuals are more obedient."

      "question": "What is one potential consequence of legitimizing authority, as discussed in the context of obedience?",
      "options": [
        "Increased moral reasoning",

        "Decreased obedience",
        "Enhanced critical thinking"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Legitimizing authority can lead individuals to justify harmful actions, as they may defer their moral values to the authority figure. This corresponds to: Justification for harmful actions."
