  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "In Asch's (1951) study on conformity, what was the effect of having a dissenter present on conformity rates?",
      "options": [
        "Conformity increased to 50%",
        "Conformity decreased to 5.5%",
        "Conformity remained unchanged",
        "Conformity decreased to 33%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of a dissenter who agreed with the participant broke the group's unanimity, leading to a significant decrease in conformity rates. This corresponds to: Conformity decreased to 5.5%."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary explanation for resistance to social influence provided by the concept of social support?",
      "options": [
        "It increases personal responsibility",
        "It provides a model for dissent",
        "It enhances group pressure",
        "It reduces individual confidence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social support helps individuals resist social influence by providing a model for dissent, making it easier to stand up against majority pressure. This corresponds to: It provides a model for dissent."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Milgram's (1963) research, how did the presence of disobedient peers affect obedience rates?",
      "options": [
        "Increased obedience to 100%",
        "Decreased obedience to 10%",
        "Had no effect on obedience",
        "Increased obedience to 50%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Milgram found that the presence of disobedient peers significantly reduced the percentage of participants who fully obeyed authority. This corresponds to: Decreased obedience to 10%."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of locus of control, how do individuals with an internal locus of control typically respond to social influence?",
      "options": [
        "They are more likely to conform",
        "They accept external pressures easily",
        "They resist social influence",
        "They are indifferent to authority"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Individuals with an internal locus of control believe they are responsible for their own actions, making them more likely to resist social influence. This corresponds to: They resist social influence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hutchins and Este's (1978) research indicated that individuals with a high internal locus of control were better at resisting what type of social influence?",
      "options": [
        "Normative social influence",
        "Informational social influence",
        "Peer pressure",
        "Groupthink"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Their research showed that high internals were more capable of resisting coercion in a simulated interrogation, highlighting the role of locus of control. This corresponds to: Informational social influence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Avtgis (1998) conducted a meta-analysis on locus of control and resistance to social influence. What was his key finding?",
      "options": [
        "No relationship was found",
        "A significant relationship exists",
        "Only external locus of control matters",
        "Only internal locus of control matters"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Avtgis found a significant relationship between locus of control scores and resistance to social influence across various studies. This corresponds to: A significant relationship exists."
    },
    {
      "question": "What limitation did Spector (1983) find regarding locus of control in resisting social influence?",
      "options": [
        "It is not applicable to all social situations",
        "It only affects normative social influence",
        "It is irrelevant in group settings",
        "It has no impact on obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Spector's findings indicated that an internal locus of control is significant in resisting normative social influence but not in resisting informational social influence. This corresponds to: It only affects normative social influence."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of social support, what did Allen and Levine (1971) demonstrate about the validity of dissenting opinions?",
      "options": [
        "Only valid dissenters reduce conformity",
        "Any dissenting opinion can reduce conformity",
        "Dissent must be expert-based",
        "Dissent has no effect on conformity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Allen and Levine showed that social support can help individuals resist conformity even when the dissenting opinion is not particularly valid. This corresponds to: Any dissenting opinion can reduce conformity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does social support play in resisting obedience according to Milgram's findings?",
      "options": [
        "It has no effect",
        "It increases obedience rates",
        "It acts as a role model for disobedience",
        "It confuses participants"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Milgram suggested that the presence of disobedient confederates acted as role models, making it more likely that real participants would also resist obedience. This corresponds to: It acts as a role model for disobedience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key characteristic of individuals with an external locus of control in the context of social influence?",
      "options": [
        "They feel empowered to resist",
        "They accept responsibility for their actions",
        "They are more likely to conform",
        "They challenge authority figures"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Individuals with an external locus of control tend to feel that their actions are determined by external factors, making them more susceptible to social influence. This corresponds to: They are more likely to conform."
