  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "In Asch's (1951) study on conformity, what effect did the presence of a dissenting confederate have on conformity rates?",
      "options": [
        "Increased conformity to 33%",
        "Decreased conformity to 5.5%",
        "Had no effect on conformity",
        "Increased conformity to 50%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of a dissenting confederate decreased conformity rates from 33% to 5.5%. This corresponds to: Decreased conformity to 5.5%."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one explanation for resistance to social influence that involves the influence of others?",
      "options": [
        "Locus of control",
        "Social support",
        "Informational social influence",
        "Normative social influence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social support is an explanation for resistance to social influence, as it provides individuals with allies against conformity or obedience"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Milgram's (1963) obedience study, how did the presence of disobedient peers affect obedience rates?",
      "options": [
        "Increased obedience to 65%",
        "Decreased obedience to 10%",
        "Had no effect on obedience",
        "Increased obedience to 80%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of disobedient peers reduced the percentage of participants who were fully obedient to just 10%. This corresponds to: Decreased obedience to 10%."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the concept of locus of control, individuals with which type of locus are more likely to resist social influence?",
      "options": [
        "External locus of control",
        "Internal locus of control",
        "Situational locus of control",
        "Normative locus of control"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Individuals with an internal locus of control are more likely to resist social influence as they believe their actions are a result of their own abilities"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study by Hutchins and Este, what was found regarding individuals with a high internal locus of control?",
      "options": [
        "They are more susceptible to social influence",
        "They are less able to resist coercion",
        "They are more able to resist coercion",
        "They conform more easily"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hutchins and Este found that individuals with a high internal locus of control were more able to resist coercion in a simulated interrogation. This corresponds to: They are more able to resist coercion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Allen and Levine's study suggest about the importance of social support in resisting conformity?",
      "options": [
        "It is irrelevant to conformity",
        "It is only effective if the supporter is valid",
        "It helps individuals resist even if the support is not valid",
        "It increases conformity rates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Allen and Levine showed that social support helped people resist conformity even when the supporter was not particularly valid. This corresponds to: It helps individuals resist even if the support is not valid."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological limitation is associated with the concept of locus of control in resisting social influence?",
      "options": [
        "It only applies to normative social influence",
        "It is not applicable in real-world settings",
        "It lacks empirical support",
        "It is too broad and vague"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Spector found that an internal locus of control was significant in resisting normative social influence but not in resisting informational social influence. This corresponds to: It only applies to normative social influence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of social support impact an individual's ability to resist obedience according to Milgram's findings?",
      "options": [
        "It has no impact",
        "It increases obedience",
        "It decreases obedience",
        "It only works in group settings"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Milgram suggested that the presence of disobedient confederates acted as role models, making it more likely that the real participant would also resist. This corresponds to: It decreases obedience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key characteristic of individuals with an external locus of control in relation to social influence?",
      "options": [
        "They take personal responsibility for their actions",
        "They feel more empowered to resist influence",
        "They believe their actions are determined by external factors",
        "They are less likely to conform"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Individuals with an external locus of control tend to accept that what happens to them is determined by external factors, making them more susceptible to social influence. This corresponds to: They believe their actions are determined by external factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does breaking the unanimity of a group play in resisting conformity, as suggested by Asch's findings?",
      "options": [
        "It has no effect on conformity",
        "It increases conformity rates",
        "It makes it easier to resist conformity",
        "It only works in large groups"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Breaking the unanimity of the group makes it easier for individuals to resist conformity, as shown by the significant drop in conformity rates when a dissenting confederate was present. This corresponds to: It makes it easier to resist conformity."
