      "question": "In Milgram's study (1963), what percentage of participants administered the maximum shock of 450V when the experimenter was present in the same room?",
      "options": [
        "35%",
        "65%",
        "48%",
        "75%"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Milgram found that 65% of participants were willing to administer the maximum shock when the experimenter was present"

      "question": "Tarnow's study (2000) on aviation accidents highlighted the dangers of what aspect of authority?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of monitoring",

        "Peer influence",
        "Situational context"

      "explanation": "Tarnow found that excessive dependence on the captain's authority led to lack of monitoring errors in aviation accidents"

      "question": "What factor was found to decrease obedience in Milgram's variations when participants had disobedient peers?",
      "options": [
        "Increased proximity",
        "Legitimacy of authority",
        "Presence of allies",
        "High status location"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Participants were less likely to continue obeying when they had peers who refused to follow orders, demonstrating the influence of disobedient models. This corresponds to: Presence of allies."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Fromm (1973), why might Milgram's findings on obedience be less surprising?",
      "options": [
        "Participants were aware of the scientific nature of the study",
        "The setting was a real-life scenario",
        "Participants had high levels of education",
        "The experiment was conducted in a public space"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Fromm suggested that the scientific context of Milgram's experiment made obedience more likely than in real-life situations. This corresponds to: Participants were aware of the scientific nature of the study."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of obedience, what does the term 'agentic state' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "A state of personal responsibility",

      "question": "What was the effect of the location on obedience levels in Milgram's study?",
      "options": [
        "Obedience increased in a prestigious setting",
        "Obedience decreased in a lower-status setting",
        "Location had no effect",
        "Obedience was higher in public locations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Milgram found that obedience levels dropped to 48% in a lower-status setting, indicating the impact of location on obedience. This corresponds to: Obedience decreased in a lower-status setting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one methodological issue with Milgram's study regarding the generalization of findings?",
      "options": [
        "Participants were all male",
        "The study was conducted in a laboratory",
        "Participants were not informed about the study's purpose",
        "The sample size was too small"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Conducting the study in a laboratory setting may limit the generalizability of the findings to real-life situations. This corresponds to: The study was conducted in a laboratory."

    {
      "question": "What did Begue et al. (2014) find regarding political orientation and obedience in their replication of Milgram's study?",
      "options": [
        "Left-wing participants were more obedient",
        "Right-wing participants showed lower obedience",
        "Left-wing participants administered higher shocks",
        "Right-wing participants administered lower shocks"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Begue et al. found that participants identifying as left-wing were less likely to administer high levels of shocks, indicating a link between political orientation and obedience. This corresponds to: Right-wing participants showed lower obedience."

        "It has no effect",
