      "question": "In Milgram's 1963 study on obedience, what percentage of participants administered the maximum shock of 450V when the experimenter was present in the same room?",

        "35%",
        "65%",
        "48%",
        "75%"

      "question": "According to Tarnow's 2000 study on aviation accidents, what was a significant factor contributing to crashes?",
      "options": [

      "question": "In a variation of Milgram's study, what effect did having two disobedient confederates have on the participant's obedience levels?",
      "options": [
        "Increased obedience",
        "Decreased obedience",
        "No effect",
        "Unpredictable effect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When participants were with two disobedient confederates, only 10% continued to the maximum shock level, indicating decreased obedience"

      "question": "What is one factor that has been shown to decrease obedience according to research on social influence?",
      "options": [
        "Presence of a legitimate authority",

        "Disobedience is more common among authoritarian individuals"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Elms and Milgram found that participants who were obedient in Milgram's study scored higher on the F scale, indicating a link to the Authoritarian Personality. This corresponds to: Participants with Authoritarian Personality scored higher on the F scale."

    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is raised by Fromm regarding Milgram's study on obedience?",
      "options": [
        "The lack of real-life applicability",
        "The use of confederates",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Fromm suggested that Milgram's laboratory setting may not accurately reflect real-life obedience, which often requires more time and manipulation. This corresponds to: The lack of real-life applicability."

      "question": "What role does education level play in obedience according to research findings?",
      "options": [
        "Higher education correlates with higher obedience",
