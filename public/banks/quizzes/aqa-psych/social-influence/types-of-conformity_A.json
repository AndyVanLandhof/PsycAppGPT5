    {
      "question": "What type of conformity involves adopting the beliefs of a group because one genuinely believes they are correct, as described by Kelman in 1958?",
      "options": [
        "Internalisation",
        "Identification",
        "Compliance",
        "Social influence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Internalisation occurs when an individual accepts the group's beliefs as true, leading to a permanent change in opinion"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Asch's (1951) study on conformity, which variable was found to significantly affect conformity rates when the group size increased?",
      "options": [
        "Task difficulty",
        "Unanimity",
        "Group size",
        "Proximity"

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Asch found that larger group sizes increased conformity rates, but only up to a point"
    },
    {
      "question": "A student decides to wear a certain style of clothing to fit in with their peers, even though they do not personally like it. This is an example of which type of conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Internalisation",
        "Identification",
        "Compliance",
        "Obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates compliance, where the student conforms to group norms for acceptance without changing their personal beliefs"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which explanation for conformity suggests that individuals conform to be accepted by a group, even if they do not agree with the groupâ€™s views?",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Normative social influence occurs when individuals conform to be liked or accepted by others"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study where participants were asked to judge the length of lines, those who conformed to the majority opinion did so because they believed the majority was correct. This is an example of which type of conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Compliance",
        "Identification",
        "Internalisation",
        "Obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario exemplifies internalisation, where the participant accepts the group's view as correct"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue can arise from studies on conformity, such as Asch's, when considering the generalizability of the findings?",
      "options": [
        "Cultural bias",
        "Sample size",
        "Task difficulty",
        "Gender bias"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Asch's study primarily involved male participants, which raises questions about the applicability of the findings to females. This corresponds to: Cultural bias."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which factor did Asch find to decrease conformity when present in a group setting?",
      "options": [
        "Increased group size",
        "Unanimity",
        "Social support",
        "Task difficulty"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Asch discovered that having at least one other person provide a different answer significantly reduced conformity. This corresponds to: Social support."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of conformity, what does the term 'unanimity' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The agreement of all group members",
        "The size of the group",
        "The difficulty of the task",
        "The presence of an authority figure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Unanimity refers to all group members agreeing on a particular answer, which increases conformity rates. This corresponds to: The agreement of all group members."
    },
    {
      "question": "A participant in a conformity experiment feels unsure about their answer and looks to others for guidance. This is an example of which type of social influence?",
      "options": [

        "Informational social influence",
        "Identification",
        "Compliance"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates informational social influence, where the individual conforms because they believe others have more accurate information"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key difference between compliance and internalisation in terms of conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Compliance is temporary; internalisation is permanent",
        "Compliance involves agreement; internalisation does not",
        "Internalisation is influenced by group size; compliance is not",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Compliance is often a temporary change in behavior, while internalisation leads to a lasting change in beliefs. This corresponds to: Compliance is temporary; internalisation is permanent."
