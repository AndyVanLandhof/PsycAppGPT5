      "question": "In Asch's (1951) study on conformity, what was the effect of having a dissenter present on conformity rates?",
      "options": [
        "Conformity increased to 50%",
        "Conformity decreased to 5.5%",
        "Conformity remained unchanged",
        "Conformity decreased to 33%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Asch found that the presence of a confederate who disagreed with the majority reduced conformity rates to 5.5%. This corresponds to: Conformity decreased to 5.5%."

      "question": "What personality characteristic is associated with an internal locus of control in resisting social influence?",
      "options": [
        "Belief in external factors",

      "question": "In Milgram's (1963) obedience study, what was the effect of having disobedient peers on the obedience rates of participants?",
      "options": [
        "Obedience increased to 65%",
        "Obedience decreased to 10%",
        "Obedience remained at 50%",
        "Obedience decreased to 33%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Milgram found that the presence of two disobedient peers reduced the percentage of fully obedient participants to just 10%. This corresponds to: Obedience decreased to 10%."

      "options": [
        "They are more likely to comply",
        "They are less likely to resist",

        "They show no significant difference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hutchins and Esteq found that individuals with a high internal locus of control were more able to resist coercion in a simulated interrogation. This corresponds to: They are more able to resist."

    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the locus of control explanation in resisting social influence, as noted by Spector (1983)?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

        "It enhances task difficulty",
        "It decreases peer pressure"
