  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "In Asch's (1951) study on conformity, what was the effect of having a dissenter present on conformity rates?",
      "options": [
        "Conformity increased to 50%",
        "Conformity decreased to 5.5%",
        "Conformity remained unchanged",
        "Conformity decreased to 33%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of a dissenter broke the unanimity of the group, leading to a significant decrease in conformity rates. This corresponds to: Conformity decreased to 5.5%."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the term 'locus of control' refer to in the context of resistance to social influence?",
      "options": [
        "The belief in external factors controlling outcomes",
        "The ability to influence others' behavior",
        "The tendency to conform to group norms",
        "The acceptance of authority figures' demands"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Locus of control refers to whether individuals believe their outcomes are controlled by internal factors (personal effort) or external factors (outside influences). This corresponds to: The belief in external factors controlling outcomes."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Milgram's (1963) study, how did the presence of disobedient peers affect obedience rates?",
      "options": [
        "Obedience increased to 60%",
        "Obedience decreased to 10%",
        "Obedience remained at 65%",
        "Obedience decreased to 30%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of disobedient peers acted as role models, significantly reducing the percentage of participants who fully obeyed. This corresponds to: Obedience decreased to 10%."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study by Hutchins and Esteq (1978), what was found regarding individuals with a high internal locus of control?",
      "options": [
        "They were more likely to conform",
        "They were less able to resist coercion",
        "They were more able to resist coercion",
        "They showed no difference in resistance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Individuals with a high internal locus of control were found to be more capable of resisting coercion in a simulated interrogation. This corresponds to: They were more able to resist coercion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does social support play in resisting social influence, as evidenced by Asch's findings?",
      "options": [
        "It has no effect on conformity",
        "It increases conformity rates",
        "It decreases conformity rates",
        "It only affects obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Social support from a dissenter in Asch's study significantly decreased conformity rates, demonstrating its importance in resisting social influence. This corresponds to: It decreases conformity rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Avtgis (1998) conducted a meta-analysis on locus of control and resistance to social influence. What was a key finding?",
      "options": [
        "No relationship was found",
        "A significant relationship was found",
        "Only external locus of control was significant",
        "Only internal locus of control was significant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Avtgis found a significant relationship between locus of control scores and resistance to social influence across various studies. This corresponds to: A significant relationship was found."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Spector's (1983) research contribute to our understanding of locus of control in resisting social influence?",
      "options": [
        "Internal locus is important for all types of influence",
        "External locus is more important than internal",
        "Internal locus is significant for normative but not informational influence",
        "Locus of control has no impact on resistance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Spector's research highlights that while an internal locus of control aids in resisting normative social influence, it does not significantly impact resistance to informational social influence. This corresponds to: Internal locus is significant for normative but not informational influence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the social support explanation for resistance to social influence?",
      "options": [
        "It only applies to conformity",
        "It lacks real-world applicability",
        "It does not account for dispositional factors",
        "It is not supported by empirical evidence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The social support explanation primarily focuses on situational factors and may overlook the role of individual personality traits in resistance. This corresponds to: It does not account for dispositional factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of resistance to social influence, what does the term 'agentic state' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "A state of personal responsibility",
        "A state of obedience to authority",
        "A state of independence from social norms",
        "A state of conformity to group pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The agentic state refers to a psychological state where individuals see themselves as agents of an authority figure, leading to obedience. This corresponds to: A state of obedience to authority."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the presence of allies affect an individual's ability to resist social influence?",
      "options": [
        "It has no effect",
        "It makes resistance more difficult",
        "It increases confidence and ability to resist",
        "It only affects conformity, not obedience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Having allies provides social support, which increases an individual's confidence and ability to resist both conformity and obedience pressures. This corresponds to: It increases confidence and ability to resist."
