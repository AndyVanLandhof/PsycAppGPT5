    {
      "question": "In Asch's (1956) study on conformity, what was the effect of having a dissenter present during the task?",
      "options": [
        "Increased conformity to 37%",
        "Decreased conformity to 5%",
        "No effect on conformity",
        "Increased conformity to 25%"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of a dissenter who did not conform reduced conformity from 33% to just 5%. This corresponds to: Decreased conformity to 5%."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between compliance and internalisation in the context of conformity?",
      "options": [
        "Compliance involves a change in private beliefs, while internalisation does not",

        "Conformity decreases with larger groups",
        "Conformity increases with larger groups",
        "Group size has no effect on conformity",
        "Conformity is highest in groups of two"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Increasing the size of the majority increased conformity in Asch's study. This corresponds to: Conformity increases with larger groups."

        "It decreases conformity",

        "It increases conformity",
        "It only affects compliance"

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Asch found that increasing task difficulty increased conformity levels among participants. This corresponds to: It increases conformity."

        "25%",

        "37%",

      "options": [
        "It lacked ecological validity",
        "It was conducted in a natural setting",
