    {
      "question": "What is the primary distinction between qualitative and quantitative data?",
      "options": [
        "Qualitative data is numerical, while quantitative data is descriptive.",
        "Qualitative data is descriptive, while quantitative data is numerical.",
        "Qualitative data is collected through experiments, while quantitative data is collected through observations.",
        "Qualitative data is always primary, while quantitative data is always secondary."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Qualitative data is descriptive and focuses on understanding concepts, while quantitative data is numerical and focuses on measurement. This corresponds to: Qualitative data is descriptive, while quantitative data is numerical.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study measuring the effects of sleep on memory, researchers collect data on participants' sleep hours and their test scores. What type of data are they collecting?",
      "options": [
        "Qualitative data",
        "Quantitative data",
        "Primary data",
        "Secondary data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The researchers are collecting quantitative data as they are measuring sleep hours and test scores numerically"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a measure of central tendency?",
      "options": [
        "Standard deviation",
        "Range",
        "Mean",
        "Correlation coefficient"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The mean is a measure of central tendency that represents the average of a data set"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a researcher finds a correlation coefficient of -0.85 between two variables, what does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A strong positive correlation",
        "A weak positive correlation",
        "A strong negative correlation",
        "No correlation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of -0.85 indicates a strong negative correlation between the two variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, participants are asked to rate their satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10. What level of measurement is this?",
      "options": [
        "Nominal",
        "Ordinal",
        "Interval",
        "Ratio"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The satisfaction ratings are measured on an interval scale, as the differences between points are meaningful"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher conducts a meta-analysis on previous studies about anxiety treatment. What type of data is primarily used in this analysis?",
      "options": [
        "Primary data",
        "Qualitative data",
        "Quantitative data",
        "Descriptive data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Meta-analysis primarily uses quantitative data collected from various studies to draw broader conclusions"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher calculates the mean score of a group of participants who completed a test. If the mean is significantly affected by an outlier, what does this suggest about the data?",
      "options": [
        "The data is normally distributed.",
        "The data may be skewed.",
        "The data is reliable.",
        "The data is valid."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "If the mean is significantly affected by an outlier, it suggests that the data may be skewed, impacting its normal distribution. This corresponds to: The data may be skewed.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing two teaching methods, the researcher uses a sign test to analyze the data. When is the sign test appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "When data is nominal",
        "When data is ordinal",
        "When data is interval",
        "When data is ratio"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The sign test is appropriate for analyzing ordinal data, particularly when comparing two related samples. This corresponds to: When data is ordinal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of using secondary data in research?",
      "options": [
        "It is always qualitative.",
        "It may not be relevant to the current study.",
        "It is more expensive to collect.",
        "It is less reliable than primary data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A limitation of using secondary data is that it may not be relevant to the current study, affecting the validity of the findings. This corresponds to: It may not be relevant to the current study.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a normal distribution?",
      "options": [
        "It has a skewed shape.",
        "It is symmetrical around the mean.",
        "It has multiple peaks.",
        "It is always positively skewed."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A normal distribution is symmetrical around the mean, with most data points clustering around the center. This corresponds to: It is symmetrical around the mean.."
