      "question": "Which of the following is a characteristic of qualitative data?",
      "options": [
        "Numerical values",
        "Descriptive information",
        "Statistical analysis",
        "Standard deviation"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Qualitative data is characterized by descriptive information rather than numerical values"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study measuring the effect of sleep on memory recall, researchers found a mean score of 75 and a median score of 70. What does this suggest about the data distribution?",
      "options": [
        "It is normally distributed",
        "It is positively skewed",
        "It is negatively skewed",
        "It has no skew"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The mean being higher than the median suggests a positive skew in the data distribution. This corresponds to: It is positively skewed."

    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of using a meta-analysis in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "To collect primary data",
        "To analyze qualitative data",
        "To synthesize findings from multiple studies",
        "To conduct experiments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Meta-analysis is used to synthesize findings from multiple studies to draw broader conclusions"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a researcher calculates a standard deviation of 5 for a set of test scores, what does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The scores are all identical",
        "Scores are widely spread around the mean",
        "Scores are clustered closely around the mean",
        "The mean is 5"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A standard deviation of 5 indicates that the scores are widely spread around the mean"

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion, not a measure of central tendency"

    {
      "question": "A researcher finds a correlation coefficient of -0.85 between stress levels and academic performance. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A strong positive relationship",
        "A weak negative relationship",
        "A strong negative relationship",
        "No relationship"

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of -0.85 indicates a strong negative relationship between stress levels and academic performance"

      "question": "What is a limitation of using secondary data in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "It is always qualitative",
        "It may not be relevant to the current study",
        "It is more expensive to obtain",
        "It is less reliable than primary data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Secondary data may not be relevant to the current study, affecting its applicability. This corresponds to: It may not be relevant to the current study."

      "options": [
        "Participants are unaware they are being observed",

        "The study is conducted in a natural setting"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In controlled observations, the researcher manipulates the environment to observe effects on behavior. This corresponds to: The environment is manipulated by the researcher."
