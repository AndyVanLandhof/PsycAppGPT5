      "options": [
        "A. Self-reports showed less genetic influence than observational data.",
        "B. Observational techniques indicated a greater environmental influence.",
        "C. Both methods provided identical results.",
        "D. Self-reports are always more reliable than observational techniques."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Observational ratings indicated a greater influence of environmental factors compared to self-reports. This corresponds to: B. Observational techniques indicated a greater environmental influence.."

    {
      "question": "During a study on classroom behavior, a researcher uses time sampling to record instances of off-task behavior. What is a potential limitation of this method?",
      "options": [
        "A. It captures all instances of behavior.",
        "B. It may miss important behaviors occurring outside the sampling intervals.",
        "C. It requires extensive training for observers.",
        "D. It is too subjective."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Time sampling may miss important behaviors that occur outside the designated intervals, potentially leading to incomplete data. This corresponds to: B. It may miss important behaviors occurring outside the sampling intervals.."

    {
      "question": "A researcher conducting a study on social interactions in a café uses a coding frame to categorize behaviors. What is the purpose of using a coding frame in observational research?",
      "options": [
        "A. To ensure that all observers interpret behaviors consistently.",
        "B. To allow for spontaneous observations without structure.",
        "C. To eliminate the need for operational definitions.",
        "D. To increase the variability of the data collected."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A coding frame helps ensure that all observers interpret behaviors consistently, enhancing the reliability of the data. This corresponds to: A. To ensure that all observers interpret behaviors consistently.."

    {
      "question": "In a study using participant observation, the researcher becomes part of the group being studied. What is a potential drawback of this method?",
      "options": [
        "A. It allows for a more objective perspective.",
        "B. It may introduce bias due to the researcher's involvement.",
        "C. It eliminates ethical concerns.",
        "D. It requires less time than other observational methods."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Participant observation may introduce bias as the researcher’s involvement can affect the behavior of the group being studied. This corresponds to: B. It may introduce bias due to the researcher's involvement.."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher is interested in the effects of a new teaching method on student engagement. They decide to observe classes using overt observation. What is a key characteristic of overt observation?",
      "options": [
        "A. Participants are unaware they are being observed.",
        "B. The researcher does not interact with participants.",
        "C. Participants know they are being observed.",
        "D. It is conducted in a controlled environment."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In overt observation, participants are aware they are being observed, which can influence their behavior. This corresponds to: C. Participants know they are being observed.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing two different observational techniques, researchers found that structured observations yielded more consistent results than unstructured observations. What does this suggest about the reliability of these methods?",
      "options": [
        "A. Structured observations are less reliable than unstructured.",
        "B. Unstructured observations are more valid than structured.",
        "C. Structured observations tend to have higher reliability.",
        "D. Both methods have equal reliability."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Higher reliability in structured observations suggests that they provide more consistent results compared to unstructured methods. This corresponds to: C. Structured observations tend to have higher reliability.."

      "question": "A researcher studying aggression uses observational techniques to assess behavior in a playground. What is a potential ethical concern with this method?",
      "options": [
        "A. It requires informed consent from participants.",
        "B. It may lead to demand characteristics.",
        "C. It is less reliable than self-report methods.",
        "D. It does not require operational definitions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Observational techniques often require informed consent, especially when observing minors, to address ethical concerns. This corresponds to: A. It requires informed consent from participants.."

      "question": "In a study on group dynamics, researchers used both participant and non-participant observations. What is a key difference between these two methods?",
      "options": [
        "A. Participant observation involves the researcher being part of the group.",
        "B. Non-participant observation is more subjective.",
        "C. Participant observation is less time-consuming.",
        "D. Non-participant observation requires more training."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The key difference is that participant observation involves the researcher actively engaging with the group, while non-participant does not. This corresponds to: A. Participant observation involves the researcher being part of the group.."
