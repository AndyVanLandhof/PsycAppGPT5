    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between qualitative and quantitative data?",
      "options": [
        "Qualitative data is numerical, while quantitative data is descriptive.",
        "Qualitative data is descriptive, while quantitative data is numerical.",
        "Qualitative data is collected through experiments, while quantitative data is collected through observations.",
        "Qualitative data is always primary, while quantitative data is always secondary."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Qualitative data provides descriptive insights, while quantitative data focuses on numerical measurements. This corresponds to: Qualitative data is descriptive, while quantitative data is numerical.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance, researchers found a correlation coefficient of -0.65. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "There is a strong positive correlation.",
        "There is a weak negative correlation.",
        "There is a strong negative correlation.",
        "There is no correlation."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of -0.65 indicates a strong negative correlation between sleep duration and academic performance. This corresponds to: There is a strong negative correlation.."

    {
      "question": "If a researcher wants to analyze the average score of a group of students, which measure of central tendency should they use?",
      "options": [
        "Mean",
        "Median",
        "Mode",
        "Range"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The mean is the most appropriate measure to analyze the average score of a group"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher collects data from a previous study to analyze the effects of a new treatment. This type of data is known as what?",
      "options": [
        "Primary data",
        "Secondary data",
        "Qualitative data",
        "Quantitative data"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Data collected from previous studies is classified as secondary data"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, participants' responses are coded into themes for analysis. This method is known as what?",
      "options": [
        "Content analysis",
        "Thematic analysis",
        "Quantitative analysis",
        "Statistical analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Thematic analysis involves identifying and coding themes within qualitative data"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher conducts an experiment and finds that the mean score of the experimental group is 75, while the control group has a mean score of 65. What can be inferred about the treatment's effect?",
      "options": [
        "The treatment had no effect.",
        "The treatment had a positive effect.",
        "The treatment had a negative effect.",
        "The results are inconclusive."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The higher mean score in the experimental group suggests a positive effect of the treatment. This corresponds to: The treatment had a positive effect.."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher uses a scattergram to display the relationship between two variables. What type of data is being presented?",
      "options": [
        "Qualitative data",
        "Quantitative data",
        "Primary data",
        "Secondary data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Scattergrams are used to display quantitative data, showing relationships between two variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "When calculating the range of a data set, which of the following steps is necessary?",
      "options": [
        "Add the highest and lowest values.",
        "Subtract the lowest value from the highest value.",
        "Calculate the mean of the data set.",
        "Identify the mode of the data set."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The range is calculated by subtracting the lowest value from the highest value in the data set. This corresponds to: Subtract the lowest value from the highest value.."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that their data is normally distributed. What characteristic does this distribution have?",
      "options": [
        "It has a skewed shape.",
        "It is symmetrical around the mean.",
        "It has multiple peaks.",
        "It is always negatively skewed."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A normal distribution is characterized by its symmetry around the mean. This corresponds to: It is symmetrical around the mean.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, a researcher uses the sign test to analyze the data. What is a key limitation of this statistical test?",
      "options": [
        "It requires interval data.",
        "It can only be used with large sample sizes.",
        "It does not provide information about the strength of the relationship.",
        "It is only applicable to qualitative data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sign test does not provide information about the strength of the relationship between variables. This corresponds to: It does not provide information about the strength of the relationship.."
