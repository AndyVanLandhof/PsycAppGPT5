    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between qualitative and quantitative data?",
      "options": [
        "Qualitative data is numerical, while quantitative data is descriptive.",
        "Qualitative data is descriptive, while quantitative data is numerical.",
        "Qualitative data is collected through experiments, while quantitative data is collected through observations.",
        "Qualitative data is always primary, while quantitative data is always secondary."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Qualitative data is descriptive and focuses on understanding concepts, while quantitative data is numerical and focuses on measuring variables. This corresponds to: Qualitative data is descriptive, while quantitative data is numerical.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study measuring the effect of sleep on test performance, researchers found a mean score of 75, a median of 78, and a mode of 80. What does this indicate about the data distribution?",
      "options": [
        "The data is normally distributed.",
        "The data is positively skewed.",
        "The data is negatively skewed.",
        "The data has no skew."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The mean, median, and mode being close together suggests a normal distribution. This corresponds to: The data is normally distributed.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a measure of dispersion in data analysis?",
      "options": [
        "Mean",
        "Median",
        "Mode",
        "Standard deviation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion that indicates how spread out the data points are around the mean"
    },

      "question": "A researcher conducts a meta-analysis using data collected from multiple studies on anxiety treatments. What type of data is being utilized?",
      "options": [
        "Primary data",
        "Qualitative data",
        "Quantitative data",
        "Secondary data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Meta-analysis uses secondary data, as it involves analyzing data collected by other researchers"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, participants' scores on a test are correlated with the number of hours they studied. If the correlation coefficient is -0.85, what does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "There is a strong positive correlation.",
        "There is a weak negative correlation.",
        "There is a strong negative correlation.",
        "There is no correlation."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of -0.85 indicates a strong negative correlation between study hours and test scores. This corresponds to: There is a strong negative correlation.."

      "question": "A researcher wants to analyze the relationship between two variables, height and weight, using a scattergram. What type of data is being displayed?",
      "options": [
        "Qualitative data",
        "Quantitative data",
        "Primary data",
        "Secondary data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A scattergram displays quantitative data, as it plots numerical values of two variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a normal distribution?",
      "options": [
        "Data is clustered around the mean with symmetrical tails.",
        "Data is skewed to the left.",
        "Data has multiple peaks.",
        "Data is uniformly distributed."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A normal distribution is characterized by data clustering around the mean with symmetrical tails. This corresponds to: Data is clustered around the mean with symmetrical tails.."
    },
    {
      "question": "When conducting a sign test, what is the primary purpose of this statistical test?",
      "options": [
        "To compare means between two groups.",
        "To determine the strength of a correlation.",
        "To assess the difference in scores before and after an intervention.",
        "To analyze qualitative data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sign test is used to assess the difference in scores before and after an intervention, particularly with paired data. This corresponds to: To assess the difference in scores before and after an intervention.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study measuring the effectiveness of a new therapy, the results show a range of scores from 10 to 90. What is the range of the data?",
      "options": [
        "80",
        "90",
        "100",
        "10"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The range is calculated by subtracting the lowest score from the highest score, which is 90 - 10 = 80"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential limitation of using secondary data in research?",
      "options": [
        "It is always qualitative.",
        "It may not be relevant to the current research question.",
        "It is more expensive to obtain.",
        "It is less reliable than primary data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A limitation of secondary data is that it may not be relevant to the current research question, affecting the validity of the findings. This corresponds to: It may not be relevant to the current research question.."
