    {
      "question": "What is a key feature of self-report techniques in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "They involve direct observation of behavior.",
        "They require participants to report their own thoughts and feelings.",
        "They manipulate independent variables.",
        "They are always conducted in a laboratory setting."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques require participants to provide information about their own experiences, thoughts, and feelings. This corresponds to: They require participants to report their own thoughts and feelings.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) developed by Holmes and Rahe, how are life events quantified?",
      "options": [
        "By assigning a score based on the number of events experienced.",
        "By calculating the average stress level of participants.",
        "By using a scale of 1 to 10 for each event.",
        "By comparing physiological responses to stress."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The SRRS quantifies life events by assigning a score based on the number of events experienced, allowing for a total score to be calculated. This corresponds to: By assigning a score based on the number of events experienced.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kanner et al. developed the Hassles and Uplifts Scale (HSUP) to measure daily stress. What is a key feature of this scale?",
      "options": [
        "It focuses solely on major life events.",
        "It includes both hassles and uplifts.",
        "It uses physiological measures of stress.",
        "It is only applicable to adults."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The HSUP includes both hassles and uplifts, allowing for a more balanced assessment of daily stressors. This corresponds to: It includes both hassles and uplifts.."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher uses a self-report questionnaire to assess stress levels in a sample of students. What is a potential limitation of this method?",
      "options": [
        "It provides objective data.",
        "Participants may respond in a socially desirable manner.",
        "It requires no interpretation of responses.",
        "It eliminates the need for ethical considerations."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Participants may respond in a socially desirable manner, which can lead to biased results and affect the validity of the data collected. This corresponds to: Participants may respond in a socially desirable manner.."
    },
    {
      "question": "When assessing the reliability of self-report measures, what method is commonly used?",
      "options": [
        "Inter-observer reliability.",
        "Test-retest reliability.",
        "Random sampling.",
        "Counterbalancing."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Test-retest reliability is commonly used to assess the consistency of self-report measures by comparing scores over time. This corresponds to: Test-retest reliability.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study using the HSUP scale, participants rate daily hassles on a scale of 1 to 3. What is a potential issue with this rating system?",
      "options": [
        "It is too complex for participants to understand.",
        "It may lead to inflated scores due to subjective interpretation.",
        "It does not allow for a comparison of uplifts.",
        "It requires participants to recall events from the past year."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The subjective interpretation of the rating scale may lead to inflated scores, as different participants may perceive the severity of hassles differently. This corresponds to: It may lead to inflated scores due to subjective interpretation.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue associated with self-report techniques like the SRRS?",
      "options": [
        "They are always conducted in controlled environments.",
        "They can suffer from social desirability bias.",
        "They provide purely qualitative data.",
        "They require no participant involvement."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques can suffer from social desirability bias, where participants may answer in a way they believe is more socially acceptable rather than truthful. This corresponds to: They can suffer from social desirability bias.."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the validity of self-report measures like the SRRS and HSUP potentially get compromised?",
      "options": [
        "By using random sampling techniques.",
        "Through the use of clear and specific questions.",
        "Due to varying interpretations of the items by different individuals.",
        "By ensuring all participants are from the same demographic."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The validity of self-report measures can be compromised due to varying interpretations of the items, leading to inconsistent responses among participants. This corresponds to: Due to varying interpretations of the items by different individuals.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a strength of using self-report techniques to measure stress?",
      "options": [
        "They provide objective physiological data.",
        "They allow for direct insight into personal experiences.",
        "They eliminate the need for participant consent.",
        "They are less time-consuming than observational methods."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques allow for direct insight into personal experiences, making them a valid way to measure subjective phenomena like stress. This corresponds to: They allow for direct insight into personal experiences.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of self-report measures, what does the term 'operationalisation' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The process of randomly assigning participants to groups.",
        "The way in which variables are defined and measured.",
        "The ethical considerations in conducting research.",
        "The statistical analysis of collected data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Operationalisation refers to the way in which variables are defined and measured in research, ensuring clarity and consistency in data collection. This corresponds to: The way in which variables are defined and measured.."
