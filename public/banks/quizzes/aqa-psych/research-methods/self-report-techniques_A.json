    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of self-report techniques in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "To observe behavior directly",
        "To measure physiological responses",
        "To gather personal insights about thoughts and feelings",
        "To manipulate variables in an experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques, such as questionnaires and interviews, are designed to collect personal insights about individuals' thoughts and feelings. This corresponds to: To gather personal insights about thoughts and feelings."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS) developed by Holmes and Rahe, how are life events rated?",
      "options": [
        "By assigning a score based on physiological responses",
        "By comparing with a control group",
        "By using a checklist of events and assigning life change units",
        "By conducting interviews with participants"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The SRRS uses a checklist of life events where participants assign life change units to events they have experienced. This corresponds to: By using a checklist of events and assigning life change units."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of self-report techniques?",
      "options": [
        "They provide objective data",
        "They can be influenced by social desirability bias",
        "They are always reliable",
        "They require no interpretation by the researcher"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques can be influenced by social desirability bias, where participants may answer in a way they believe is more socially acceptable. This corresponds to: They can be influenced by social desirability bias."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study using the Hassles and Uplifts Scale (HSUP), participants rate each hassle on a scale of 1 to 3. What does this scale measure?",
      "options": [
        "The frequency of life events",
        "The severity of daily hassles and uplifts",
        "The physiological response to stress",
        "The overall life satisfaction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The HSUP measures the severity of daily hassles and uplifts by having participants rate each item on a scale"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher uses a self-report questionnaire to assess stress levels in a sample of college students. What is a potential issue with this method?",
      "options": [
        "It provides quantitative data",
        "It may lack representativeness",
        "It is time-consuming",
        "It requires no participant input"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The sample of college students may lack representativeness, limiting the generalizability of the findings to the broader population. This corresponds to: It may lack representativeness."
    },
    {
      "question": "When assessing the reliability of self-report measures, which method is commonly used?",
      "options": [
        "Inter-observer reliability",
        "Test-retest reliability",
        "Content analysis",
        "Pilot studies"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Test-retest reliability is used to assess the consistency of self-report measures by comparing scores from the same individuals over time"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that participants interpret the item 'serious illness/injury' on a self-report scale differently. What methodological issue does this highlight?",
      "options": [
        "Social desirability bias",
        "Ambiguity in questions",
        "Observer bias",
        "Sampling bias"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The differing interpretations of ambiguous items highlight a methodological issue that can affect the validity of self-report measures. This corresponds to: Ambiguity in questions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a strength of using self-report techniques to measure stress?",
      "options": [
        "They provide objective physiological data",
        "They allow for direct insight into personal experiences",
        "They eliminate bias",
        "They are less time-consuming than interviews"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques provide direct insight into personal experiences, making them a valid way to measure subjective phenomena like stress. This corresponds to: They allow for direct insight into personal experiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of self-report techniques, what does 'social desirability bias' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "Participants providing accurate responses",
        "Participants answering in a way they believe is socially acceptable",
        "Participants misunderstanding questions",
        "Participants failing to respond"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social desirability bias occurs when participants answer questions in a manner they believe will be viewed favorably by others. This corresponds to: Participants answering in a way they believe is socially acceptable."

      "options": [
        "Self-report techniques are more objective",
        "Observational methods rely on participant input",
        "Self-report techniques gather subjective data",
        "Observational methods are less time-consuming"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques gather subjective data based on personal insights, whereas observational methods focus on objective behavior"
