    {
      "question": "In a study examining children's play behavior, researchers used naturalistic observation to record interactions without interference. What is a key advantage of this observational technique?",
      "options": [
        "A. High control over variables",
        "B. High ecological validity",
        "C. Ability to establish cause and effect",
        "D. Low observer bias"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Naturalistic observation provides high ecological validity as it captures behavior in a natural setting. This corresponds to: B. High ecological validity."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher is studying aggressive behavior in children using structured observations with predefined behavioral categories. What is a potential limitation of this method?",
      "options": [
        "A. It lacks objectivity",
        "B. It may miss spontaneous behaviors",
        "C. It is time-consuming",
        "D. It requires extensive training"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Structured observations may miss spontaneous behaviors that do not fit into predefined categories. This corresponds to: B. It may miss spontaneous behaviors."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study on classroom behavior, researchers used participant observation to gather data. What is a disadvantage of this approach?",
      "options": [
        "A. Observer bias may influence results",
        "B. It provides quantitative data",
        "C. It lacks depth of understanding",
        "D. It is less time-consuming"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Participant observation can lead to observer bias, as the researcher may become too involved in the group being studied. This corresponds to: A. Observer bias may influence results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes covert observation?",
      "options": [
        "A. Participants are aware they are being observed",
        "B. Observations are conducted in a controlled environment",
        "C. Participants are unaware they are being observed",
        "D. Observers interact with participants during the study"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Covert observation involves observing participants without their knowledge, minimizing the influence of demand characteristics. This corresponds to: C. Participants are unaware they are being observed."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher conducting a study on social interactions in a caf√© uses time sampling to record behaviors. What is a key benefit of this technique?",
      "options": [
        "A. It captures all behaviors in detail",
        "B. It reduces the amount of data collected",
        "C. It allows for a broader range of behaviors to be recorded",
        "D. It ensures all behaviors are equally represented"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Time sampling helps ensure that a variety of behaviors are recorded systematically over time. This corresponds to: D. It ensures all behaviors are equally represented."
    },
    {
      "question": "In observational research, inter-observer reliability is crucial. What does this term refer to?",
      "options": [
        "A. The consistency of observations between different observers",
        "B. The accuracy of a single observer's recordings",
        "C. The ability to replicate a study's findings",
        "D. The use of multiple observation techniques"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Inter-observer reliability assesses the consistency of observations made by different observers, ensuring data accuracy. This corresponds to: A. The consistency of observations between different observers."
    },
    {
      "question": "A study using overt observation found that participants altered their behavior when they knew they were being watched. What methodological issue does this highlight?",
      "options": [
        "A. Observer bias",
        "B. Demand characteristics",
        "C. Low ecological validity",
        "D. Lack of operational definitions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Demand characteristics occur when participants change their behavior due to awareness of being observed, affecting the study's validity. This corresponds to: B. Demand characteristics."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study on aggression, researchers used both self-report and observational techniques. What is a potential issue with relying solely on self-reports?",
      "options": [
        "A. They provide qualitative data",
        "B. They may be influenced by social desirability bias",
        "C. They are time-consuming to analyze",
        "D. They lack depth of understanding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-reports can be affected by social desirability bias, where participants may not provide truthful responses. This corresponds to: B. They may be influenced by social desirability bias."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between participant and non-participant observation?",
      "options": [
        "A. Participant observation involves the researcher being part of the group",
        "B. Non-participant observation is always covert",
        "C. Participant observation is less time-consuming",
        "D. Non-participant observation provides richer data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In participant observation, the researcher actively engages with the group being studied, while in non-participant observation, they remain an outsider. This corresponds to: A. Participant observation involves the researcher being part of the group."
    },
    {
      "question": "When conducting observational research, what is the purpose of using behavioral categories?",
      "options": [
        "A. To ensure all behaviors are recorded",
        "B. To simplify data analysis",
        "C. To increase the reliability of observations",
        "D. To reduce the time spent observing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Behavioral categories help increase the reliability of observations by providing clear definitions for what is being recorded. This corresponds to: C. To increase the reliability of observations."
