      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Laboratory experiments are conducted in controlled environments where the researcher manipulates the independent variable. This corresponds to: B. Laboratory experiment."

      "question": "A researcher conducts a study to determine if sleep deprivation affects cognitive performance. They randomly assign participants to either a sleep-deprived group or a control group. What type of experimental design is being used?",
      "options": [
        "A. Quasi-experiment",
        "B. Field experiment",
        "C. Laboratory experiment",
        "D. Natural experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario describes a laboratory experiment where the independent variable (sleep deprivation) is manipulated in a controlled setting. This corresponds to: C. Laboratory experiment."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of laboratory experiments?",
      "options": [
        "A. High ecological validity",
        "B. Low control over variables",
        "C. Demand characteristics",
        "D. Naturalistic observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Laboratory experiments often suffer from demand characteristics, where participants may alter their behavior due to the awareness of being studied. This corresponds to: C. Demand characteristics."

    {
      "question": "In a study examining the impact of a new teaching method on student performance, the researcher uses pre- and post-tests to measure outcomes. What is the dependent variable in this study?",
      "options": [
        "A. The teaching method",
        "B. The students' performance",
        "C. The pre-test scores",
        "D. The post-test scores"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The dependent variable is the students' performance, which is measured by comparing pre- and post-test scores. This corresponds to: B. The students' performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key characteristic of field experiments compared to laboratory experiments?",
      "options": [
        "A. Higher control over variables",
        "B. Conducted in natural settings",
        "C. Always use random sampling",
        "D. Focus on qualitative data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Field experiments are conducted in natural settings, which can enhance ecological validity compared to laboratory experiments. This corresponds to: B. Conducted in natural settings."

    {
      "question": "A researcher wants to study the effects of a new drug on anxiety levels. They assign participants to either receive the drug or a placebo. What type of experimental method is being employed?",
      "options": [
        "A. Quasi-experiment",
        "B. Natural experiment",
        "C. Laboratory experiment",
        "D. Field experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario describes a laboratory experiment where the independent variable (drug vs. placebo) is manipulated in a controlled environment. This corresponds to: C. Laboratory experiment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a quasi-experiment?",
      "options": [
        "A. Random assignment to conditions",
        "B. Manipulation of the independent variable",
        "C. Use of pre-existing groups",
        "D. Conducted in a controlled environment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Quasi-experiments involve the use of pre-existing groups rather than random assignment to conditions. This corresponds to: C. Use of pre-existing groups."

    {
      "question": "What is a potential ethical issue in experimental research?",
      "options": [
        "A. High reliability",
        "B. Informed consent",
        "C. Low ecological validity",
        "D. Use of control groups"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Informed consent is a critical ethical consideration, as participants must be fully aware of the nature of the study and their involvement. This corresponds to: B. Informed consent."
    },
    {
      "question": "In an experiment, if the researcher finds that increasing the amount of study time improves test scores, what can be concluded?",
      "options": [
        "A. There is a correlation between study time and test scores",
        "B. Study time is the only factor affecting test scores",
        "C. A causal relationship exists between study time and test scores",
        "D. Test scores do not depend on study time"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "If the researcher manipulated study time and observed changes in test scores, a causal relationship can be inferred from the experimental design. This corresponds to: C. A causal relationship exists between study time and test scores."
