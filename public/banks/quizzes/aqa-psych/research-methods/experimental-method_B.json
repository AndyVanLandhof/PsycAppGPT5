    {
      "question": "Which type of experiment involves manipulating the independent variable in a controlled environment to establish a causal relationship?",
      "options": [
        "Field experiment",
        "Laboratory experiment",
        "Natural experiment",
        "Quasi-experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Laboratory experiments are conducted in controlled environments, allowing researchers to manipulate the independent variable and measure its effect on the dependent variable"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance, researchers randomly assigned participants to either a sleep-deprived group or a control group. What type of experimental method is being used?",
      "options": [
        "Field experiment",
        "Natural experiment",
        "Laboratory experiment",
        "Quasi-experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario describes a laboratory experiment where participants are randomly assigned to conditions, allowing for control over variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key advantage of using the experimental method in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "High ecological validity",
        "Ability to establish cause and effect",
        "Low demand characteristics",
        "Rich qualitative data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The experimental method allows researchers to manipulate variables and establish causal relationships, which is a fundamental strength of this approach. This corresponds to: Ability to establish cause and effect."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Milgram's (1963) study on obedience, participants were deceived about the true nature of the experiment. What methodological issue does this raise?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of ecological validity",
        "Ethical concerns regarding deception",
        "Low reliability of findings",
        "Inability to replicate results"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The use of deception in Milgram's study raises ethical concerns, as participants were not fully informed about the nature of the research. This corresponds to: Ethical concerns regarding deception."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a type of experimental method?",
      "options": [
        "Laboratory experiment",
        "Field experiment",
        "Naturalistic observation",
        "Quasi-experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Naturalistic observation is a non-experimental method, while the other options are types of experimental methods"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher conducts a study where they observe the behavior of children in a playground without intervening. What type of observational method is being used?",
      "options": [
        "Controlled observation",
        "Covert observation",
        "Naturalistic observation",
        "Participant observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Naturalistic observation involves observing behavior in its natural environment without interference from the researcher"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of laboratory experiments in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "High ecological validity",
        "Low control over variables",
        "Demand characteristics may influence behavior",
        "Inability to measure dependent variables"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Laboratory experiments may produce demand characteristics, where participants alter their behavior due to the experimental setting. This corresponds to: Demand characteristics may influence behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a quasi-experiment, the independent variable is typically based on what?",
      "options": [
        "Random assignment",
        "Natural occurrences",
        "Manipulated conditions",
        "Participant characteristics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Quasi-experiments involve independent variables that are based on participant characteristics, such as age or gender, rather than being manipulated by the researcher"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher is interested in the relationship between study time and exam performance. They find a positive correlation between the two variables. What can be concluded?",
      "options": [
        "Study time causes better exam performance",
        "Better exam performance causes more study time",
        "There is a relationship between study time and exam performance",
        "Study time and exam performance are unrelated"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A positive correlation indicates a relationship between study time and exam performance, but it does not establish causation. This corresponds to: There is a relationship between study time and exam performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the role of the dependent variable in an experimental study?",
      "options": [
        "It is manipulated by the researcher",
        "It is measured to assess the effect of the independent variable",
        "It is kept constant throughout the study",
        "It is the variable that is not controlled"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The dependent variable is the outcome that is measured to assess the effect of the manipulation of the independent variable. This corresponds to: It is measured to assess the effect of the independent variable."
