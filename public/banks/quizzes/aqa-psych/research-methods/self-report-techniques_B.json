    {
      "question": "What is a key characteristic of self-report techniques in psychology?",
      "options": [
        "They involve direct observation of behavior.",
        "They require participants to report their own thoughts and feelings.",
        "They manipulate independent variables.",
        "They are always conducted in a laboratory."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques, such as questionnaires and interviews, require participants to provide their own accounts of their experiences and feelings. This corresponds to: They require participants to report their own thoughts and feelings.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the SRRS (Social Readjustment Rating Scale), how are life events quantified?",
      "options": [
        "By assigning a score based on the number of events experienced.",
        "By calculating the average stress level of participants.",
        "By rating events on a scale of 1 to 10.",
        "By comparing physiological responses."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The SRRS quantifies life events by asking participants to indicate how many events they have experienced and assigning life change units to each event. This corresponds to: By assigning a score based on the number of events experienced.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a common limitation of self-report techniques, such as the HSUP scale?",
      "options": [
        "They are always conducted in controlled environments.",
        "Participants may interpret questions differently, affecting validity.",
        "They cannot measure subjective experiences.",
        "They require extensive training for researchers."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A limitation of self-report techniques like the HSUP scale is that participants may interpret items differently, which can lead to inflated or deflated stress scores. This corresponds to: Participants may interpret questions differently, affecting validity.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes social desirability bias in self-report techniques?",
      "options": [
        "Participants may provide answers that reflect their true feelings.",
        "Participants may answer in a way that they believe is more socially acceptable.",
        "Participants are always honest in their responses.",
        "Participants may not understand the questions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social desirability bias occurs when participants provide answers they believe are more socially acceptable rather than their true feelings. This corresponds to: Participants may answer in a way that they believe is more socially acceptable.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main advantage of using self-report techniques to measure stress?",
      "options": [
        "They provide objective physiological data.",
        "They allow for direct insight into personal experiences of stress.",
        "They eliminate the need for participant interpretation.",
        "They are less time-consuming than observational methods."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques are advantageous because they provide direct insight into individuals' personal experiences of stress. This corresponds to: They allow for direct insight into personal experiences of stress.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study using the HSUP scale, participants rated their daily hassles and uplifts. What is a potential issue with this method?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks a clear scoring system.",
        "It may not capture the full range of stress experiences.",
        "It requires participants to recall events from memory.",
        "It is too complex for most participants."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A potential issue with the HSUP scale is that it may not capture the full range of stress experiences, as it focuses on specific hassles and uplifts. This corresponds to: It may not capture the full range of stress experiences.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological concern when using self-report measures like the SRRS?",
      "options": [
        "They are always reliable.",
        "They can be influenced by participants' current mood.",
        "They require extensive training for participants.",
        "They do not allow for participant feedback."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report measures like the SRRS can be influenced by participants' current mood, which may affect the accuracy of their responses. This corresponds to: They can be influenced by participants' current mood.."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does test-retest reliability apply to self-report techniques?",
      "options": [
        "It assesses the consistency of scores over time.",
        "It compares different observers' ratings.",
        "It measures physiological responses.",
        "It evaluates the clarity of questions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Test-retest reliability assesses the consistency of scores for individuals when the same self-report measure is administered at different times. This corresponds to: It assesses the consistency of scores over time.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key difference between self-report techniques and observational methods?",
      "options": [
        "Self-report techniques are more objective.",
        "Observational methods do not require participant input.",
        "Self-report techniques measure behavior directly.",
        "Observational methods are less time-consuming."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A key difference is that observational methods do not require participant input, while self-report techniques rely on individuals to provide their own accounts. This corresponds to: Observational methods do not require participant input.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential bias in self-report measures that can affect the validity of findings?",
      "options": [
        "Observer bias.",
        "Social desirability bias.",
        "Sampling bias.",
        "Confirmation bias."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social desirability bias can affect the validity of findings in self-report measures, as participants may provide answers they think are more acceptable rather than their true feelings. This corresponds to: Social desirability bias.."
