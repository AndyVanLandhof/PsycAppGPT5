  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is a primary characteristic of self-report techniques in psychology?",
      "options": [
        "They involve direct observation of behavior.",
        "They require participants to report their own thoughts and feelings.",
        "They use physiological measurements.",
        "They are always conducted in a laboratory."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques, such as questionnaires and interviews, require participants to provide their own accounts of their experiences and feelings. This corresponds to: They require participants to report their own thoughts and feelings.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the SRRS (Social Readjustment Rating Scale), how are life events rated?",
      "options": [
        "On a scale of 1 to 10",
        "By assigning life change units based on a reference event",
        "Through open-ended responses",
        "By comparing with physiological data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The SRRS uses life change units assigned to various life events, with marriage as an arbitrary reference point of 500 units. This corresponds to: By assigning life change units based on a reference event."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher uses the HSUP (Hassles and Uplifts Scale) to measure stress. Participants rate 117 hassles and 135 uplifts. What is a potential limitation of this self-report measure?",
      "options": [
        "It is too objective.",
        "It may lead to socially desirable responses.",
        "It does not account for daily variations in stress.",
        "It is not based on real-life experiences."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Participants may respond in a socially desirable manner, which can skew the results and affect the validity of the findings. This corresponds to: It may lead to socially desirable responses.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a methodological issue associated with self-report techniques?",
      "options": [
        "They are always reliable.",
        "They can lead to demand characteristics.",
        "They require no participant involvement.",
        "They are less valid than observational methods."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques can lead to demand characteristics, where participants alter their responses based on perceived expectations. This corresponds to: They can lead to demand characteristics.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a common method for assessing the reliability of self-report measures?",
      "options": [
        "Inter-observer reliability",
        "Test-retest reliability",
        "Pilot studies",
        "Random sampling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Test-retest reliability involves repeating the same measure after a short interval to check for consistency in responses"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study using self-report techniques, participants may interpret questions differently. What is this phenomenon known as?",
      "options": [
        "Social desirability bias",
        "Response bias",
        "Interpretation bias",
        "Demand characteristics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Interpretation bias occurs when participants have varying understandings of the questions, affecting the validity of their responses"
    },
    {
      "question": "When using self-report techniques, what is a significant advantage of asking participants about their stress levels?",
      "options": [
        "It provides objective data.",
        "It allows for a direct understanding of personal experiences.",
        "It eliminates the need for ethical considerations.",
        "It ensures high reliability."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques directly capture personal experiences, making them a valid way to measure subjective phenomena like stress. This corresponds to: It allows for a direct understanding of personal experiences.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential drawback of using self-report measures like the SRRS?",
      "options": [
        "They are too complex for participants.",
        "They may reflect illness rather than predict it.",
        "They require extensive training for researchers.",
        "They are always reliable."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report measures may reflect existing conditions rather than predict future outcomes, which can limit their practical application. This corresponds to: They may reflect illness rather than predict it.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of self-report technique involves structured questions that limit the responses of participants?",
      "options": [
        "Unstructured interviews",
        "Open-ended questionnaires",
        "Closed questionnaires",
        "Focus groups"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Closed questionnaires restrict responses to predefined options, making data analysis easier but potentially limiting depth of insight"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key difference between self-report techniques and observational methods?",
      "options": [
        "Self-report techniques are more objective.",
        "Observational methods require participants to reflect on their thoughts.",
        "Self-report techniques rely on participant honesty.",
        "Observational methods are less time-consuming."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques depend on the honesty and self-awareness of participants, while observational methods do not require such introspection. This corresponds to: Self-report techniques rely on participant honesty.."
