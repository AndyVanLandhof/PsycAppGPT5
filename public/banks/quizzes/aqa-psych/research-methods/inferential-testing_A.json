    {
      "question": "Which statistical test is appropriate for analyzing the difference between two related samples?",
      "options": [
        "Mann-Whitney",
        "Wilcoxon",
        "Chi-Squared",
        "Pearson's r"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Wilcoxon test is specifically designed for related samples, making it suitable for this scenario"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the relationship between gender and coffee preference, which statistical test would be most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Mann-Whitney",
        "Chi-Squared",
        "Related t-test",
        "Spearman's rho"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Chi-Squared test is suitable for nominal data and assesses associations between categorical variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a researcher finds a p-value of 0.03, what can be concluded about the significance of their results?",
      "options": [
        "Results are not significant at p < 0.01",
        "Results are significant at p < 0.05",
        "Results are significant at p < 0.10",
        "Results are not significant at p < 0.05"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A p-value of 0.03 indicates significance at the 0.05 level, meaning the results are statistically significant. This corresponds to: Results are significant at p < 0.05."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a Type I error in statistical testing?",
      "options": [
        "Failing to reject a false null hypothesis",
        "Rejecting a true null hypothesis",
        "Accepting a true alternative hypothesis",
        "Failing to detect a true effect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, leading to a false positive. This corresponds to: Rejecting a true null hypothesis."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study with two independent groups, which test would be appropriate if the data is ordinal?",
      "options": [
        "Pearson's r",
        "Mann-Whitney",
        "Related t-test",
        "Chi-Squared"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Mann-Whitney test is suitable for comparing two independent groups with ordinal data"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher uses a Chi-Squared test to analyze the relationship between two categorical variables. What is a key assumption of this test?",
      "options": [
        "Data must be normally distributed",
        "Data must be independent",
        "Data must be interval",
        "Data must be paired"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Chi-Squared test assumes that the data is independent, meaning no item can appear in more than one cell. This corresponds to: Data must be independent."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing the effectiveness of two teaching methods, a researcher uses a related t-test. What type of design is this?",
      "options": [
        "Independent groups design",
        "Repeated measures design",
        "Matched pairs design",
        "Cross-sectional design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A related t-test is used in a repeated measures design where the same participants are tested under both conditions"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the critical value for a Mann-Whitney test with a sample size of 10 and an alpha level of 0.05?",
      "options": [
        "5",
        "10",
        "15",
        "20"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The critical value for a Mann-Whitney test with 10 participants can be found in statistical tables, and for this scenario, it is 5"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements best describes a Type II error?",
      "options": [
        "Rejecting a true null hypothesis",
        "Failing to reject a false null hypothesis",
        "Accepting a false alternative hypothesis",
        "Detecting a true effect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A Type II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected, leading to a false negative. This corresponds to: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should a researcher use Spearman's rho instead of Pearson's r?",
      "options": [
        "When data is normally distributed",
        "When data is ordinal",
        "When data is interval",
        "When data is nominal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Spearman's rho is used for ordinal data, while Pearson's r requires interval or ratio data. This corresponds to: When data is ordinal."
