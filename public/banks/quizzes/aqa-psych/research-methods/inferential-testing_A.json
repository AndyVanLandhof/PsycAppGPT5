    {
      "question": "In a study examining the effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance, researchers used a sign test to analyze the data. What type of data is most appropriate for this test?",
      "options": [
        "Nominal",
        "Ordinal",
        "Interval",
        "Ratio"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The sign test is used for ordinal data, which ranks differences between paired observations"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher conducts a Mann-Whitney test to compare the test scores of two independent groups. What is a key assumption of this test?",
      "options": [
        "Data must be normally distributed",
        "Data must be interval or ratio",
        "Data must be ordinal",
        "Data must be nominal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Mann-Whitney test is a non-parametric test that requires ordinal data for comparison between two independent groups. This corresponds to: Data must be ordinal."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, participants were asked to choose their preferred type of coffee from four options. The data collected is nominal. Which inferential test would be most appropriate to analyze this data?",
      "options": [
        "Wilcoxon",
        "Chi-Squared",
        "Pearson's r",
        "Related t-test"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Chi-Squared test is suitable for analyzing nominal data to determine if there is an association between variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds a significant result with a p-value of 0.03 when using a Wilcoxon test. What does this indicate about the null hypothesis?",
      "options": [
        "It is accepted",
        "It is rejected",
        "It is confirmed",
        "It is irrelevant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A p-value of 0.03 indicates that the result is statistically significant, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis. This corresponds to: It is rejected."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing the effectiveness of two teaching methods, the researcher uses an unrelated t-test. What type of design is being employed?",
      "options": [
        "Repeated measures",
        "Matched pairs",
        "Independent groups",
        "Longitudinal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "An unrelated t-test is used when comparing two independent groups, indicating an independent groups design"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher conducts a study using a Chi-Squared test and finds a critical value of 5.99 at p < 0.05. If the calculated Chi-Squared value is 6.50, what should the researcher conclude?",
      "options": [
        "Accept the null hypothesis",
        "Reject the null hypothesis",
        "Further testing is needed",
        "Results are inconclusive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Since the calculated value (6.50) exceeds the critical value (5.99), the null hypothesis should be rejected. This corresponds to: Reject the null hypothesis."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a psychological study, a researcher uses a Spearman's rho test to analyze the correlation between hours studied and exam scores. What type of data is required for this test?",
      "options": [
        "Nominal",
        "Ordinal",
        "Interval",
        "Ratio"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Spearman's rho is a non-parametric test that requires ordinal data to assess the strength and direction of a relationship"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher is concerned about Type I errors in their study. What does a Type I error represent?",
      "options": [
        "Failing to reject a false null hypothesis",
        "Rejecting a true null hypothesis",
        "Accepting a true alternative hypothesis",
        "Failing to detect a true effect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, leading to a false positive result. This corresponds to: Rejecting a true null hypothesis."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing two different therapies, a researcher uses a related t-test. What is a potential limitation of this test?",
      "options": [
        "Requires independent samples",
        "Assumes normal distribution",
        "Can only be used with nominal data",
        "Does not account for outliers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A related t-test assumes that the differences between paired observations are normally distributed, which can limit its applicability. This corresponds to: Assumes normal distribution."
    },
    {
      "question": "When using inferential statistics, what is the purpose of using critical value tables?",
      "options": [
        "To determine the sample size needed",
        "To assess the reliability of the data",
        "To interpret significance levels",
        "To calculate means and medians"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Critical value tables are used to interpret significance levels by comparing calculated test statistics to critical values"
