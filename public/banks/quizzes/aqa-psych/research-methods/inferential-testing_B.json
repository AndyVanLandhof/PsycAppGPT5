    {
      "question": "In a study examining the effect of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance, researchers used a Mann-Whitney test to analyze the data. What type of data is most appropriate for this test?",
      "options": [
        "Nominal",
        "Ordinal",
        "Interval",
        "Ratio"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Mann-Whitney test is used for ordinal data, which ranks the data points rather than measuring them on a scale"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher is testing whether there is a significant difference in test scores between two different teaching methods. If the data is normally distributed, which inferential test should the researcher use?",
      "options": [
        "Chi-Squared",
        "Mann-Whitney",
        "Unrelated t-test",
        "Wilcoxon"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The unrelated t-test is appropriate for comparing means between two independent groups when the data is normally distributed"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study with two groups of participants, one receiving a new therapy and the other receiving standard treatment, the results showed a p-value of 0.03. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The results are not significant",
        "There is a significant difference at p < 0.05",
        "The results are significant at p < 0.01",
        "The null hypothesis is accepted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A p-value of 0.03 indicates a significant difference at the 0.05 level, suggesting the new therapy may be effective. This corresponds to: There is a significant difference at p < 0.05."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher conducts a Chi-Squared test to examine the relationship between gender and coffee preference. What type of data is being analyzed?",
      "options": [
        "Ordinal",
        "Nominal",
        "Interval",
        "Ratio"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Chi-Squared test is used for nominal data, which categorizes participants into groups without a numerical value"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a psychological study, participants' scores on a stress questionnaire are compared before and after a relaxation intervention using a related t-test. What is a key assumption of this test?",
      "options": [
        "Data must be nominal",
        "Data must be independent",
        "Data must be normally distributed",
        "Data must be ordinal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The related t-test assumes that the differences between paired observations are normally distributed. This corresponds to: Data must be normally distributed."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds a significant result using a Wilcoxon test with a p-value of 0.04. What type of error could occur if the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected?",
      "options": [
        "Type I error",
        "Type II error",
        "Sampling error",
        "Measurement error"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true, which is a risk when p < 0.05"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing the effectiveness of two diets, the researcher uses Spearman's rho to analyze the data. What type of relationship is this test assessing?",
      "options": [
        "Causal relationship",
        "Linear relationship",
        "Monotonic relationship",
        "No relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Spearman's rho assesses the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher uses a sign test to analyze the data from a repeated measures design. What is a key characteristic of this test?",
      "options": [
        "It requires interval data",
        "It is a parametric test",
        "It is a non-parametric test",
        "It assumes normal distribution"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sign test is a non-parametric test used for analyzing differences in repeated measures data. This corresponds to: It is a non-parametric test."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the association between exercise frequency and mood, a researcher calculates a Chi-Squared statistic. What is a critical factor for using this test?",
      "options": [
        "Data must be continuous",
        "Data must be independent",
        "Data must be normally distributed",
        "Data must be ordinal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Chi-Squared test requires that the data be independent, meaning no participant can belong to more than one category. This corresponds to: Data must be independent."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that the critical value for a Mann-Whitney test is 15, but their calculated value is 20. What can the researcher conclude?",
      "options": [
        "The results are significant",
        "The results are not significant",
        "The null hypothesis is accepted",
        "The test is invalid"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "If the calculated value exceeds the critical value, the results are not significant, indicating no difference between groups"
