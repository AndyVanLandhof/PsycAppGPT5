    {
      "question": "Which statistical test would be appropriate for analyzing the difference in coffee preferences between males and females, given that the data is nominal?",
      "options": [
        "Mann-Whitney",
        "Chi-Squared",
        "Wilcoxon",
        "Pearson's r"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Chi-Squared test is suitable for nominal data to assess differences in frequencies across categories"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing two groups of participants on their reaction times, which inferential test should be used if the same participants are tested under both conditions?",
      "options": [
        "Unrelated t-test",
        "Related t-test",
        "Mann-Whitney",
        "Chi-Squared"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The related t-test is used when the same participants are involved in both conditions"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds a significant result with a p-value of 0.03. What does this indicate about the findings?",
      "options": [
        "The result is not significant at p < 0.01",
        "The result is significant at p < 0.05",
        "The result is significant at p < 0.10",
        "The result is not significant at p < 0.05"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A p-value of 0.03 indicates significance at the 0.05 level, meaning the null hypothesis can be rejected. This corresponds to: The result is significant at p < 0.05."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study using the Mann-Whitney test, researchers found a U value of 15 with a critical value of 20. What can be concluded?",
      "options": [
        "The results are not significant",
        "The results are significant",
        "The data is normally distributed",
        "The sample sizes are equal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Since the U value of 15 is less than the critical value of 20, the results are significant"
    },
    {
      "question": "When conducting a Chi-Squared test, which of the following is a necessary condition for the data?",
      "options": [
        "Data must be ordinal",
        "Data must be nominal",
        "Data must be interval",
        "Data must be ratio"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Chi-Squared test requires nominal data to assess differences in frequencies across categories. This corresponds to: Data must be nominal."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher uses a Wilcoxon test to analyze data from a study with 10 participants. What type of design is likely being used?",
      "options": [
        "Independent groups design",
        "Matched pairs design",
        "Repeated measures design",
        "Cross-sectional design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Wilcoxon test is used for related samples, indicating a repeated measures design"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study comparing two independent groups, if the data is ordinal, which statistical test should be used?",
      "options": [
        "Pearson's r",
        "Mann-Whitney",
        "Related t-test",
        "Chi-Squared"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Mann-Whitney test is appropriate for comparing two independent groups with ordinal data"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Type I error in the context of inferential statistics?",
      "options": [
        "Failing to reject a false null hypothesis",
        "Rejecting a true null hypothesis",
        "Accepting a false alternative hypothesis",
        "Failing to detect a true effect"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, leading to a false positive. This corresponds to: Rejecting a true null hypothesis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements about the Spearman's rho test is true?",
      "options": [
        "It is used for nominal data",
        "It assesses the strength of a linear relationship",
        "It is a non-parametric test",
        "It requires normally distributed data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Spearman's rho is a non-parametric test used to assess the strength of a relationship between two variables. This corresponds to: It is a non-parametric test."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a researcher uses an unrelated t-test and finds a significant result, what does this imply about the two groups being compared?",
      "options": [
        "They are dependent on each other",
        "They are significantly different",
        "They are the same",
        "They have a correlation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A significant result from an unrelated t-test indicates that the two independent groups are significantly different. This corresponds to: They are significantly different."
