      "question": "What is a key characteristic of case studies in psychology?",
      "options": [
        "They provide quantitative data only",
        "They focus on large sample sizes",
        "They involve detailed analysis of an individual or event",
        "They are always conducted over a short period"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Case studies involve a detailed and in-depth analysis of an individual, group, institution, or event. This corresponds to: They involve detailed analysis of an individual or event."

      "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of using case studies?",
      "options": [
        "They provide rich qualitative data",
        "They can be generalized to the wider population",
        "They may involve subjective interpretation by researchers",
        "They are always longitudinal"

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Case studies can be subjectively interpreted by researchers, which can affect the validity of the findings. This corresponds to: They may involve subjective interpretation by researchers."

      "question": "A psychologist conducts a case study on a patient with a rare disorder. What type of data is likely to be collected?",

      "question": "Which of the following best describes a methodological issue with case studies?",
      "options": [
        "They are always ethically sound",

        "They require large sample sizes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Case studies often involve unique individuals, which makes it difficult to generalize findings to the wider population. This corresponds to: They often involve unique individuals, limiting generalizability."
