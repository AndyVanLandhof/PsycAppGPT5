        "C. Natural experiment",
        "D. Quasi-experiment"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Laboratory experiments allow researchers to control variables and establish cause-and-effect relationships. This corresponds to: B. Laboratory experiment."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Skinner used the experimental method, specifically the Skinner box, to manipulate reinforcement and measure behavior. This corresponds to: C. Experimental method."

    {
      "question": "A researcher conducts a study to determine if sleep deprivation affects cognitive performance. They randomly assign participants to either a sleep-deprived group or a control group. What type of experiment is this?",

        "A. Quasi-experiment",
        "B. Field experiment",
        "C. Laboratory experiment",
        "D. Natural experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This is a laboratory experiment as it involves manipulation of the independent variable in a controlled setting. This corresponds to: C. Laboratory experiment."

    {
      "question": "What is a key characteristic of field experiments compared to laboratory experiments?",
      "options": [
        "A. They are conducted in controlled environments.",
        "B. They often have higher ecological validity.",
        "C. They do not manipulate independent variables.",
        "D. They are less expensive to conduct."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Field experiments are conducted in natural settings, which often increases their ecological validity. This corresponds to: B. They often have higher ecological validity.."

    {
      "question": "In a study examining the effects of a new teaching method on student performance, the researcher finds that students taught with the new method score higher on tests. What type of research method is primarily used here?",
      "options": [
        "A. Observational study",
        "B. Quasi-experiment",
        "C. Laboratory experiment",
        "D. Correlational study"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario suggests a quasi-experimental design as it compares groups without random assignment. This corresponds to: B. Quasi-experiment."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of the experimental method?",
      "options": [
        "A. It allows for the establishment of causal relationships.",
        "B. It can be difficult to replicate findings.",
        "C. It may lack ecological validity.",
        "D. It is always ethical."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Experimental methods often lack ecological validity because they are conducted in controlled environments that may not reflect real-world settings. This corresponds to: C. It may lack ecological validity.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of using a control group in an experimental study?",
      "options": [
        "A. To manipulate the independent variable",
        "B. To measure the dependent variable",
        "C. To compare the effects of the independent variable",
        "D. To increase the sample size"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A control group allows researchers to compare the effects of the independent variable against a baseline. This corresponds to: C. To compare the effects of the independent variable."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a laboratory experiment, a researcher measures the time it takes for participants to complete a task after being exposed to different levels of distraction. What is the independent variable in this study?",
      "options": [
        "A. The time taken to complete the task",
        "B. The level of distraction",
        "C. The participants' age",
        "D. The type of task"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The level of distraction is manipulated by the researcher, making it the independent variable. This corresponds to: B. The level of distraction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a natural experiment?",
      "options": [
        "A. The researcher manipulates the independent variable in a lab.",
        "B. The researcher observes behavior in a natural setting without manipulation.",
        "C. The independent variable is naturally occurring and not manipulated by the researcher.",
        "D. The study is conducted in a controlled environment."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In a natural experiment, the independent variable is not manipulated by the researcher but occurs naturally. This corresponds to: C. The independent variable is naturally occurring and not manipulated by the researcher.."
