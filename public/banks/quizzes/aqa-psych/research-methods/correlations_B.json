    {
      "question": "Fraley (2002) found correlations between early attachment and later relationships ranging from .50 to .10. What does this suggest about the stability of attachment types?",
      "options": [
        "Attachment types are very stable.",
        "Attachment types are not very stable.",
        "All attachment types are equally stable.",
        "Attachment types are only stable in secure attachments."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Fraley's findings indicate that low correlations pose a challenge to the idea that attachment type is stable over time. This corresponds to: Attachment types are not very stable.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the relationship between anxiety and performance, researchers found that performance is best at moderate anxiety levels. This illustrates which type of correlation?",
      "options": [
        "Positive correlation",
        "Negative correlation",
        "Curvilinear correlation",
        "Zero correlation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The relationship between anxiety and performance is curvilinear, indicating that both too high and too low anxiety can impair performance. This corresponds to: Curvilinear correlation."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher is analyzing the relationship between hours studied and exam scores, finding a correlation coefficient of +0.75. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A weak positive relationship",
        "A strong positive relationship",
        "No relationship",
        "A strong negative relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of +0.75 indicates a strong positive relationship between the two variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "A study finds a correlation of -0.30 between social media use and academic performance. What can be inferred from this result?",
      "options": [
        "Increased social media use is associated with higher academic performance.",
        "There is no relationship between social media use and academic performance.",
        "Increased social media use is associated with lower academic performance.",
        "Social media use has no impact on academic performance."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A negative correlation of -0.30 suggests that as social media use increases, academic performance tends to decrease. This corresponds to: Increased social media use is associated with lower academic performance.."
    },
    {
      "question": "When using correlational research, which of the following is a significant limitation regarding causation?",
      "options": [
        "Correlations can only show relationships, not cause and effect.",
        "Correlational studies are always biased.",
        "Correlations are only useful for linear relationships.",
        "Correlational studies cannot use statistical tests."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Correlational research can identify relationships between variables but cannot establish causation. This corresponds to: Correlations can only show relationships, not cause and effect.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a meta-analysis of studies on early attachment and later relationships, Fraley (2002) found correlations as low as .10. What does this suggest about the reliability of attachment theory?",
      "options": [
        "Attachment theory is universally accepted.",
        "Attachment theory may not reliably predict future relationships.",
        "All studies support attachment theory.",
        "Attachment types are always stable."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The low correlations challenge the reliability of attachment theory in predicting later relationship outcomes. This corresponds to: Attachment theory may not reliably predict future relationships.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the difference between a correlation and an experiment?",
      "options": [
        "Correlations manipulate variables, while experiments do not.",
        "Experiments can establish cause and effect, while correlations cannot.",
        "Correlations require random sampling, while experiments do not.",
        "Experiments measure relationships, while correlations measure differences."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Experiments are designed to establish cause and effect relationships, whereas correlations only show associations between variables. This corresponds to: Experiments can establish cause and effect, while correlations cannot.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study assessing the impact of childhood attachment on adult relationships, researchers relied on participants' memories of their childhood. What methodological issue does this present?",
      "options": [
        "It may lead to biased results due to inaccurate memories.",
        "It ensures high reliability of the data collected.",
        "It eliminates the need for longitudinal studies.",
        "It guarantees that all participants have similar experiences."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Relying on participants' memories can introduce bias and inaccuracies, affecting the validity of the findings. This corresponds to: It may lead to biased results due to inaccurate memories.."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a researcher finds a correlation coefficient of 0, what does this indicate about the relationship between the two variables studied?",
      "options": [
        "There is a strong positive relationship.",
        "There is a strong negative relationship.",
        "There is no relationship.",
        "There is a curvilinear relationship."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates that there is no relationship between the two variables. This corresponds to: There is no relationship.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements about correlation coefficients is true?",
      "options": [
        "They can only range from 0 to 1.",
        "They indicate the strength and direction of a relationship.",
        "They can only be positive.",
        "They are only applicable in experimental research."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correlation coefficients range from -1 to +1 and indicate both the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. This corresponds to: They indicate the strength and direction of a relationship.."
