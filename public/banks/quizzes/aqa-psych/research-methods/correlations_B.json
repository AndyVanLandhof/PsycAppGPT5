    {
      "question": "Fraley (2002) found correlations between early attachment and later relationships ranging from .50 to .10. What does a correlation of .10 suggest?",
      "options": [
        "A strong positive relationship",
        "No relationship",
        "A weak positive relationship",
        "A strong negative relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation of .10 indicates a weak positive relationship, suggesting that early attachment has little predictive power over later relationships"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study assessing the relationship between anxiety and performance, it was found that performance is best at moderate anxiety levels. What type of correlation does this illustrate?",
      "options": [
        "Positive correlation",
        "Negative correlation",
        "Curvilinear correlation",
        "Zero correlation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This illustrates a curvilinear correlation, where performance is optimal at moderate anxiety levels, rather than a linear relationship"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds a correlation coefficient of -0.75 between stress levels and academic performance. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A strong positive relationship",
        "A weak positive relationship",
        "A strong negative relationship",
        "No relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of -0.75 indicates a strong negative relationship, meaning as stress levels increase, academic performance decreases"
    },
    {
      "question": "A psychologist conducts a study and finds a correlation of 0.00 between two variables. What does this imply?",
      "options": [
        "A strong positive relationship",
        "A strong negative relationship",
        "No relationship",
        "A curvilinear relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation of 0.00 implies no relationship between the two variables being studied"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the relationship between childhood attachment styles and adult relationships, researchers found low correlations. What methodological issue does this highlight?",
      "options": [
        "Retrospective classification may be inaccurate",
        "The sample size was too large",
        "The variables were not operationalised",
        "The study used a longitudinal design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Low correlations may indicate that retrospective classification of childhood attachment styles could be inaccurate, affecting the validity of the findings. This corresponds to: Retrospective classification may be inaccurate."

    {
      "question": "A researcher is analyzing the relationship between two continuous variables and finds a correlation coefficient of +0.85. What can be inferred from this result?",
      "options": [
        "There is a strong positive relationship",
        "There is no relationship",
        "There is a weak negative relationship",
        "There is a curvilinear relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of +0.85 indicates a strong positive relationship between the two variables. This corresponds to: There is a strong positive relationship."
    },
    {
      "question": "When examining the correlation between two variables, a researcher notes that the relationship is not linear but curved. What type of correlation is this?",
      "options": [
        "Positive correlation",
        "Negative correlation",
        "Curvilinear correlation",
        "Zero correlation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A curvilinear correlation indicates that the relationship between the two variables is not linear but follows a curved pattern"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, the researcher finds that insecure-resistant attachment is more unstable, which may lead to low correlations in attachment research. What does this suggest about the stability of attachment types?",
      "options": [
        "Attachment types are very stable",
        "Attachment types are not stable",
        "Attachment types are always positive",
        "Attachment types are always negative"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This suggests that attachment types, particularly insecure-resistant attachment, may not be stable over time, challenging the notion of attachment stability. This corresponds to: Attachment types are not stable."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher uses a scattergram to plot the relationship between two variables. What does the scattergram visually represent?",
      "options": [
        "The mean of the variables",
        "The relationship between the co-variables",
        "The difference between the variables",
        "The standard deviation of the variables"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A scattergram visually represents the relationship between the two co-variables being investigated. This corresponds to: The relationship between the co-variables."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a correlational study, a researcher finds a correlation of +0.30 between exercise frequency and mood. What does this indicate about the relationship?",
      "options": [
        "A strong positive relationship",
        "A weak positive relationship",
        "No relationship",
        "A strong negative relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A correlation of +0.30 indicates a weak positive relationship, suggesting that as exercise frequency increases, mood tends to improve slightly"
