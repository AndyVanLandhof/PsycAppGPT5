    {
      "question": "Fraley (2002) found correlations between early attachment and later relationships ranging from .50 to .10. What does this suggest about the stability of attachment types?",
      "options": [
        "Attachment types are very stable.",
        "Attachment types are not very stable.",
        "All attachment types are equally stable.",
        "Attachment types are only stable in secure attachments."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Fraley's findings indicate that low correlations challenge the notion of attachment stability. This corresponds to: Attachment types are not very stable.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study measuring the relationship between anxiety and performance, which type of correlation would best describe the relationship where performance is optimal at moderate anxiety levels?",
      "options": [
        "Positive correlation",
        "Negative correlation",
        "Zero correlation",
        "Curvilinear correlation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The relationship is curvilinear as performance is best at moderate anxiety, not a straight line. This corresponds to: Curvilinear correlation."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds a correlation coefficient of -0.8 between stress levels and academic performance. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A strong positive relationship",
        "A strong negative relationship",
        "No relationship",
        "A weak negative relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A correlation coefficient of -0.8 indicates a strong negative relationship between the two variables"
    },
    {
      "question": "A psychologist conducts a study and finds a correlation of 0.0 between hours studied and exam scores. What can be inferred?",
      "options": [
        "Studying has no effect on exam scores.",
        "Studying negatively affects exam scores.",
        "There is no predictable relationship between studying and exam scores.",
        "Studying positively affects exam scores."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A correlation of 0.0 indicates no predictable relationship between the two variables. This corresponds to: There is no predictable relationship between studying and exam scores.."

    {
      "question": "In a study examining childhood attachment types and adult relationships, what methodological issue could affect the validity of the findings?",
      "options": [
        "Use of random sampling",
        "Retrospective classification of childhood attachment",
        "Longitudinal study design",
        "Use of qualitative data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retrospective classification may lead to inaccuracies in recalling childhood attachment types. This corresponds to: Retrospective classification of childhood attachment."

    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of correlational research compared to experimental research?",
      "options": [
        "It cannot establish cause and effect.",
        "It requires random allocation.",
        "It is less reliable.",
        "It cannot use statistical analysis."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Correlational research cannot establish cause and effect, unlike experimental research. This corresponds to: It cannot establish cause and effect.."

    {
      "question": "If a researcher finds a correlation of +0.3 between two variables, what does this imply about their relationship?",
      "options": [
        "There is a strong positive relationship.",
        "There is a weak positive relationship.",
        "There is no relationship.",
        "There is a strong negative relationship."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A correlation of +0.3 indicates a weak positive relationship between the two variables. This corresponds to: There is a weak positive relationship.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study measuring the relationship between sleep duration and mood, the researcher finds a correlation of +0.5. What does this suggest?",
      "options": [
        "Longer sleep is associated with better mood.",
        "Longer sleep is associated with worse mood.",
        "There is no relationship between sleep and mood.",
        "Mood has no effect on sleep."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A correlation of +0.5 suggests that longer sleep is associated with better mood. This corresponds to: Longer sleep is associated with better mood.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the range of values for a correlation coefficient, and what does it signify?",
      "options": [
        "-1 to +1, indicating strength and direction of the relationship.",
        "0 to +1, indicating only positive relationships.",
        "-1 to 0, indicating negative relationships only.",
        "0 to +1, indicating strength only."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, indicating both the strength and direction of the relationship. This corresponds to: -1 to +1, indicating strength and direction of the relationship.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a zero correlation?",
      "options": [
        "A perfect positive relationship",
        "A perfect negative relationship",
        "No predictable relationship",
        "A strong positive relationship"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A zero correlation indicates that there is no predictable relationship between the two variables"
