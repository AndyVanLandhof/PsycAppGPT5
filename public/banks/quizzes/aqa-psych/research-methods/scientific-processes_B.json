        "Laboratory experiment",
        "Field experiment",
        "Natural experiment",
        "Quasi-experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A laboratory experiment is conducted in a controlled environment where the researcher manipulates the independent variable"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance, researchers found a correlation coefficient of +0.75. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "A strong positive relationship",
        "A strong negative relationship",
        "No relationship",
        "A weak positive relationship"

      "question": "Joanna is conducting a questionnaire to assess the experiences of girls in Uganda regarding homework. To ensure reliability, which method could she use?",
      "options": [
        "Pilot study",
        "Test-retest method",
        "Random sampling",
        "Content analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The test-retest method involves asking the same questions again after a period to check for consistency in responses"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which observational technique involves the researcher being part of the group being studied?",
      "options": [
        "Covert observation",
        "Overt observation",
        "Participant observation",
        "Non-participant observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Participant observation requires the researcher to engage with the group being studied, providing deeper insights"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study using a questionnaire, if the questions are ambiguous and lead to varied interpretations, what issue does this primarily affect?",
      "options": [
        "Reliability",
        "Validity",
        "Generalizability",
        "Sampling bias"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ambiguous questions can lead to misunderstandings, affecting the validity of the data collected"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key limitation of using self-report techniques like questionnaires?",
      "options": [
        "They are time-consuming",
        "They may suffer from social desirability bias",
        "They require a large sample size",
        "They cannot provide qualitative data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques can be influenced by social desirability bias, where respondents answer in a way they think is favorable. This corresponds to: They may suffer from social desirability bias."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of conducting a pilot study in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "To test the hypothesis",
        "To identify potential issues in the research design",
        "To gather data for analysis",
        "To ensure ethical standards are met"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A pilot study helps researchers identify and rectify potential issues in the research design before the main study. This corresponds to: To identify potential issues in the research design."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a naturalistic observation, what is the primary advantage compared to controlled observation?",
      "options": [
        "Higher reliability",
        "Greater ecological validity",
        "Easier data collection",
        "Less researcher bias"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Naturalistic observations have greater ecological validity as they occur in real-world settings, reflecting genuine behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which sampling technique involves selecting participants based on specific characteristics to ensure representation?",
      "options": [
        "Random sampling",
        "Stratified sampling",
        "Opportunity sampling",
        "Systematic sampling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Stratified sampling ensures that subgroups within a population are represented proportionally in the sample"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between a directional hypothesis and a non-directional hypothesis?",
      "options": [
        "Directional hypotheses predict the direction of the effect, while non-directional do not",
        "Directional hypotheses are always tested in experiments",
        "Non-directional hypotheses are more specific",
        "Directional hypotheses require larger samples"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A directional hypothesis specifies the expected direction of the relationship, whereas a non-directional hypothesis does not. This corresponds to: Directional hypotheses predict the direction of the effect, while non-directional do not."
