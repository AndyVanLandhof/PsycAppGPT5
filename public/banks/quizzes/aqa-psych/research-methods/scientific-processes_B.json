        "Natural experiment",
        "Quasi-experiment"

      "question": "In Joanna's research on girls in Uganda, which method could she use to ensure her questionnaire is reliable?",
      "options": [
        "Pilot study",
        "Naturalistic observation",
        "Case study",
        "Content analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A pilot study allows Joanna to test her questionnaire on a small group before full deployment, helping to identify any issues with reliability"

    {
      "question": "What is a key limitation of self-report techniques such as questionnaires?",
      "options": [
        "They are always qualitative",
        "They can be influenced by demand characteristics",
        "They require a large sample size",
        "They are time-consuming"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques can be influenced by demand characteristics, where participants alter their responses based on perceived expectations. This corresponds to: They can be influenced by demand characteristics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which sampling technique involves selecting participants based on specific characteristics to ensure representation?",
      "options": [
        "Random sampling",
        "Stratified sampling",
        "Opportunity sampling",
        "Systematic sampling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subgroups and selecting participants from each subgroup to ensure representation"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the relationship between study time and exam scores, which method would best analyze the data?",
      "options": [
        "Experimental method",
        "Correlational analysis",
        "Case study",
        "Content analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correlational analysis is used to examine the relationship between two co-variables, such as study time and exam scores"

    {
      "question": "What is one strength of using observational techniques in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "They provide quantitative data",
        "They allow for manipulation of variables",
        "They can capture natural behavior",
        "They eliminate ethical concerns"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Observational techniques can capture natural behavior in real-world settings, enhancing ecological validity. This corresponds to: They can capture natural behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of validity assesses whether a study's findings can be generalized to real-world settings?",
      "options": [
        "Internal validity",
        "External validity",
        "Face validity",
        "Construct validity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "External validity refers to the extent to which findings can be generalized beyond the study's specific conditions"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study where participants are asked to recall a list of words, what type of data is being collected?",
      "options": [
        "Qualitative data",
        "Quantitative data",
        "Primary data",
        "Secondary data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Quantitative data is numerical and can be measured, such as the number of words recalled by participants"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of a pilot study in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "To collect final data",
        "To test the feasibility of the research design",
        "To ensure ethical approval",
        "To analyze results statistically"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A pilot study tests the feasibility of the research design and identifies any issues before the main study is conducted. This corresponds to: To test the feasibility of the research design."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential issue with using a questionnaire that includes leading questions?",
      "options": [
        "Increased reliability",
