      "question": "What type of experiment involves manipulating an independent variable in a controlled environment to observe its effect on a dependent variable?",
      "options": [
        "Laboratory experiment",
        "Field experiment",
        "Natural experiment",
        "Quasi-experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A laboratory experiment is characterized by the manipulation of an independent variable in a controlled setting"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Joanna's research on girls in Uganda, which method could she use to ensure the reliability of her questionnaire?",
      "options": [
        "Inter-observer reliability",
        "Test-retest method",
        "Content analysis",
        "Naturalistic observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The test-retest method involves administering the same questionnaire to the same participants at a later time to check for consistency in responses"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which sampling technique involves selecting participants based on their availability at the time of the study?",
      "options": [
        "Random sampling",
        "Stratified sampling",
        "Opportunity sampling",
        "Systematic sampling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Opportunity sampling selects participants who are readily available, which can introduce bias"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key limitation of using self-report techniques such as questionnaires?",
      "options": [
        "They are time-consuming",
        "They can lead to demand characteristics",
        "They require a large sample size",
        "They are difficult to analyze"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques can lead to demand characteristics, where participants alter their responses based on perceived expectations. This corresponds to: They can lead to demand characteristics."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance, what type of data analysis would be appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Content analysis",
        "Correlational analysis",
        "Experimental analysis",
        "Case study analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correlational analysis is used to examine the relationship between two co-variables, such as sleep duration and academic performance"
    },
    {
      "question": "If Joanna's questionnaire has low reliability, what implication does this have for her research findings?",
      "options": [
        "The findings may lack ecological validity",
        "The findings may not be generalizable",
        "The findings may not be valid",
        "The findings may be too complex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Low reliability suggests that the results may not accurately reflect the true experiences of the participants, impacting the validity of the findings. This corresponds to: The findings may not be valid."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a strength of using observational techniques in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "They are always ethical",
        "They provide quantitative data",
        "They can capture natural behavior",
        "They eliminate all bias"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Observational techniques can capture natural behavior in real-world settings, enhancing ecological validity. This corresponds to: They can capture natural behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of conducting a pilot study in psychological research?",
      "options": [
        "To gather qualitative data",
        "To test the reliability of the research instruments",
        "To ensure ethical standards are met",
        "To increase sample size"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A pilot study is conducted to test the reliability and validity of research instruments before the main study. This corresponds to: To test the reliability of the research instruments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of validity refers to the extent to which a study's findings can be generalized to real-world settings?",
      "options": [
        "Internal validity",
        "External validity",
        "Construct validity",
        "Face validity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "External validity refers to the generalizability of study findings to real-world contexts"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue arises from using a non-random sampling technique like opportunity sampling?",
      "options": [
        "Increased reliability",
        "Reduced generalizability",
        "Higher ecological validity",
        "Greater control over variables"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Opportunity sampling can lead to reduced generalizability because the sample may not represent the wider population"
