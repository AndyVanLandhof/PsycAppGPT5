    {
      "question": "What type of experiment involves manipulating an independent variable in a controlled environment to observe its effect on a dependent variable?",
      "options": [
        "Field experiment",
        "Laboratory experiment",
        "Natural experiment",
        "Quasi-experiment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A laboratory experiment is characterized by the manipulation of the independent variable in a controlled setting"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Joanna's study on girls' experiences in Uganda, which method could she use to ensure the reliability of her questionnaire?",
      "options": [
        "Inter-observer reliability",
        "Test-retest method",
        "Content analysis",
        "Naturalistic observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The test-retest method involves asking the same participants the same questions at different times to check for consistency in their responses"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which sampling technique involves selecting participants based on their availability and willingness to participate?",
      "options": [
        "Random sampling",
        "Stratified sampling",
        "Opportunity sampling",
        "Systematic sampling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Opportunity sampling selects participants who are readily available and willing to take part in the study"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key limitation of using self-report techniques such as questionnaires?",
      "options": [
        "High ecological validity",
        "Social desirability bias",
        "Low reliability",
        "High cost"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-report techniques can be affected by social desirability bias, where participants may answer in a way they think is more acceptable rather than being truthful"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the relationship between sleep duration and academic performance, which statistical method would be most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Content analysis",
        "Correlation analysis",
        "Experimental design",
        "Case study"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Correlation analysis is used to examine the relationship between two co-variables, such as sleep duration and academic performance"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of observation involves the researcher being part of the group being studied?",
      "options": [
        "Covert observation",
        "Overt observation",
        "Participant observation",
        "Controlled observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Participant observation requires the researcher to engage with the group they are studying, providing insights from within the group"
    },
    {
      "question": "If Joanna's questionnaire has low reliability, what might this indicate about her data?",
      "options": [
        "The data is highly valid",
        "Participants understood the questions well",
        "Responses may not be consistent",
        "The sample size is too large"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Low reliability suggests that participants may not have answered consistently, which can undermine the validity of the data collected. This corresponds to: Responses may not be consistent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one advantage of using a structured interview over an unstructured interview?",
      "options": [
        "Greater flexibility",
        "More in-depth responses",
        "Easier to analyze data",
        "Higher ecological validity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Structured interviews provide a set format that makes it easier to analyze responses quantitatively. This corresponds to: Easier to analyze data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a quasi-experiment?",
      "options": [
        "Manipulation of an independent variable in a lab",
        "Comparison of naturally occurring groups",
        "Random assignment to conditions",
        "Use of a control group"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A quasi-experiment involves comparing naturally occurring groups without random assignment, often due to ethical or practical constraints. This corresponds to: Comparison of naturally occurring groups."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main purpose of conducting a pilot study before the main research?",
      "options": [
        "To increase sample size",
        "To test the reliability of the questionnaire",
        "To refine research methods",
        "To ensure ethical standards are met"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A pilot study helps researchers refine their methods and identify any issues before conducting the main study. This corresponds to: To refine research methods."
