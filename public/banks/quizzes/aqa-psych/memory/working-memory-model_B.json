    {
      "question": "What does the working memory model propose about short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "It is a single store.",
        "It consists of multiple stores.",
        "It relies solely on rehearsal.",
        "It has unlimited capacity."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The working memory model suggests that short-term memory is divided into multiple stores, such as the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad. This corresponds to: It consists of multiple stores.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the case study of KF (Shallice and Washington, 1974), what type of information could KF recall and process?",
      "options": [
        "Visual information",
        "Verbal information",
        "Both visual and verbal information",
        "Neither visual nor verbal information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "KF could recall and process visual information but had difficulty with verbal information, indicating an impairment in the articulatory loop"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the working memory model differ from the multi-store model regarding rehearsal?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal is essential in both models.",
        "Rehearsal is the only process in the working memory model.",
        "Rehearsal is less emphasized in the working memory model.",
        "Rehearsal is not mentioned in either model."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The working memory model places less emphasis on rehearsal compared to the multi-store model, allowing for other processes to explain memory retention. This corresponds to: Rehearsal is less emphasized in the working memory model.."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a student is solving a math problem and holds intermediate results in mind, which component of the working memory model are they using?",
      "options": [
        "Episodic buffer",
        "Central executive",
        "Phonological loop",
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The central executive is responsible for managing and coordinating the different components of working memory during complex tasks"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the central executive in the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "It has a clearly defined function.",
        "It is well-supported by empirical evidence.",
        "It is too vague and simplistic.",
        "It is easy to test experimentally."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the central executive is too vague and simplistic, making it difficult to design tasks to test its function effectively. This corresponds to: It is too vague and simplistic.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which component of the working memory model was added by Baddeley in 2000?",
      "options": [
        "Phonological loop",
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad",
        "Central executive",
        "Episodic buffer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The episodic buffer was added to the working memory model by Baddeley in 2000 to integrate information from different sources"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a person is trying to remember a phone number while simultaneously writing it down, which two components of the working memory model are likely being used?",
      "options": [
        "Phonological loop and episodic buffer",
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad and central executive",
        "Phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad",
        "Central executive and episodic buffer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The phonological loop helps with verbal information like the phone number, while the visuo-spatial sketchpad aids in the physical act of writing. This corresponds to: Phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the working memory model suggest about the nature of short-term memory compared to the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "It is unitary and simple.",
        "It is complex and multi-faceted.",
        "It relies solely on auditory information.",
        "It has a fixed duration."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The working memory model indicates that short-term memory is complex and consists of multiple components, unlike the unitary view of the multi-store model. This corresponds to: It is complex and multi-faceted.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a methodological issue associated with studying the central executive?",
      "options": [
        "It is easy to define and measure.",
        "It lacks empirical support.",
        "It is too complex to study.",
        "It is universally accepted."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The central executive's vague definition makes it challenging to gather empirical evidence to support its existence and function. This corresponds to: It lacks empirical support.."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the working memory model, which component is primarily responsible for processing auditory information?",
      "options": [
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad",
        "Episodic buffer",
        "Phonological loop",
        "Central executive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The phonological loop is responsible for processing auditory information, such as sounds and verbal material"
