    {
      "question": "What does the working memory model (WMM) propose about short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "It is a single store.",
        "It consists of multiple stores.",
        "It relies heavily on rehearsal.",
        "It is identical to long-term memory."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The WMM suggests that short-term memory is divided into multiple stores, such as the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad. This corresponds to: It consists of multiple stores.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the case study of KF (Shallice and Washington, 1974), what type of information could KF recall effectively?",
      "options": [
        "Verbal information",
        "Visual information",
        "Both verbal and visual information",
        "Neither verbal nor visual information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "KF could recall and process visual information but had difficulty recalling words verbally, indicating an impairment in the articulatory loop"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the WMM, which component is responsible for processing visual and spatial information?",
      "options": [
        "Central executive",
        "Phonological loop",
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad",
        "Episodic buffer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The visuo-spatial sketchpad is specifically responsible for processing visual and spatial information in the working memory model"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a student is trying to remember a complex math problem while also listening to music, which component of the WMM is likely being used?",
      "options": [
        "Episodic buffer",
        "Phonological loop",
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad",
        "Central executive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The central executive manages the allocation of resources and attention, which is necessary when multitasking, such as solving a math problem while listening to music"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the central executive in the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "It is too complex to measure.",
        "It has a limited capacity.",
        "It is well-defined and understood.",
        "It is the most researched component."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The central executive is often criticized for being too vague and simplistic, making it difficult to design tasks to empirically test its functions. This corresponds to: It is too complex to measure.."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the WMM differ from the multi-store model (MSM) regarding rehearsal?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal is the only process in WMM.",
        "WMM does not emphasize rehearsal as much as MSM.",
        "Both models emphasize rehearsal equally.",
        "WMM suggests rehearsal is unnecessary."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The WMM allows for other processes to explain how information enters long-term memory, unlike the MSM which heavily emphasizes rehearsal. This corresponds to: WMM does not emphasize rehearsal as much as MSM.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the WMM, what role does the episodic buffer play?",
      "options": [
        "It processes auditory information.",
        "It integrates information from different stores.",
        "It is responsible for visual processing.",
        "It manages attention."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The episodic buffer integrates information from the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad, and long-term memory. This corresponds to: It integrates information from different stores.."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that participants struggle to perform a verbal task while simultaneously completing a visual task. What does this suggest about the WMM?",
      "options": [
        "It supports the idea of a single store for STM.",
        "It indicates that the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad can work simultaneously.",
        "It suggests that the central executive has unlimited capacity.",
        "It supports the idea of separate stores for different types of information."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The difficulty in performing both tasks simultaneously suggests that the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad are separate stores with limited capacity. This corresponds to: It supports the idea of separate stores for different types of information.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence does the case study of KF provide for the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "It supports the idea of a unitary short-term memory.",
        "It shows that short-term memory is made up of multiple stores.",
        "It indicates that rehearsal is essential for memory.",
        "It suggests that memory is a holistic process."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "KF's ability to process visual information but not verbal information supports the WMM's claim that short-term memory consists of multiple stores. This corresponds to: It shows that short-term memory is made up of multiple stores.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following components of the WMM is primarily responsible for auditory information?",
      "options": [
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad",
        "Episodic buffer",
        "Central executive",
        "Phonological loop"
