      "question": "What component of the working memory model is responsible for processing visual and spatial information?",
      "options": [
        "Central Executive",
        "Episodic Buffer",
        "Phonological Loop",
        "Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad"

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad processes visual and spatial information, as outlined in the working memory model"
    },

      "question": "In Shallice and Washington's (1974) case study of KF, what type of information could he recall and process effectively?",
      "options": [
        "Verbal information",
        "Visual information",
        "Both verbal and visual information",
        "Neither verbal nor visual information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "KF could recall and process visual information but had trouble recalling words verbally, indicating an impairment in the articulatory loop"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the working memory model, which component is described as 'attention' and is responsible for directing attention and resources?",
      "options": [
        "Phonological Loop",
        "Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad",
        "Central Executive",
        "Episodic Buffer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Central Executive is responsible for directing attention and managing resources in the working memory model"

      "question": "If a student is trying to remember a complex mathematical equation while solving it, which component of the working memory model are they primarily using?",
      "options": [
        "Episodic Buffer",
        "Phonological Loop",
        "Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad",
        "Central Executive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The student is using the Central Executive to manage and process the information while solving the equation"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the Central Executive component in the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "It has a limited capacity.",
        "It is too vague and lacks empirical support.",
        "It cannot process visual information.",
        "It is not involved in memory retrieval."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the Central Executive is too vague and simplistic, lacking empirical evidence for its existence. This corresponds to: It is too vague and lacks empirical support.."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the working memory model differ from the multi-store model of memory regarding rehearsal?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal is not necessary in the working memory model.",
        "Rehearsal is the only process in the working memory model.",
        "Rehearsal is emphasized more in the working memory model.",
        "Rehearsal is irrelevant in the multi-store model."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The working memory model does not place as much emphasis on rehearsal compared to the multi-store model. This corresponds to: Rehearsal is not necessary in the working memory model.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What addition was made to the working memory model by Baddeley in 2000?",
      "options": [
        "Central Executive",
        "Episodic Buffer",
        "Phonological Loop",
        "Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Baddeley added the Episodic Buffer to the working memory model in 2000 to account for the integration of information"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the capacity of the phonological loop in the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "Unlimited",
        "Limited to 7±2 items",
        "Limited to 4 chunks",
        "Varies depending on the task"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The phonological loop has a limited capacity, often described as 7±2 items, similar to the short-term memory in the multi-store model. This corresponds to: Limited to 7±2 items."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with the study of KF that supports the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "Small sample size",
        "Lack of control over variables",
        "Use of self-report measures",
        "Generalizability of findings"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The case study of KF involved a small sample size, which limits the generalizability of the findings to the broader population"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the episodic buffer in the working memory model do?",
      "options": [
        "Stores visual information",
        "Integrates information from different sources",
        "Processes auditory information",
        "Manages attention"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The episodic buffer integrates information from different sources, linking the visual and auditory information in working memory"
