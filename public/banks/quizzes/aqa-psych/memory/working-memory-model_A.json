    {
      "question": "What does the working memory model (WMM) propose about short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "It is a single unitary store.",
        "It consists of multiple stores.",
        "It relies solely on rehearsal.",
        "It has unlimited capacity."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The WMM suggests that short-term memory is divided into multiple qualitatively different stores, unlike the multi-store model which views it as a single store. This corresponds to: It consists of multiple stores.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the case study of KF (Shallice and Washington, 1974), what specific memory impairment did he exhibit?",
      "options": [
        "Impaired visual memory",
        "Impaired verbal memory",
        "Impaired long-term memory",
        "Intact auditory memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "KF could recall and process visual information but had trouble recalling words verbally, indicating an impairment in the articulatory loop. This corresponds to: Impaired verbal memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the WMM, which component is responsible for processing visual and spatial information?",
      "options": [
        "Central executive",
        "Episodic buffer",
        "Phonological loop",
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The visuo-spatial sketchpad is specifically responsible for processing visual and spatial information in the working memory model"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a student is solving a math problem and temporarily holds intermediate results in their mind, which component of the WMM are they using?",
      "options": [
        "Central executive",
        "Episodic buffer",
        "Phonological loop",
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The central executive manages and coordinates the information held in working memory while the student processes the math problem"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the central executive in the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "It has a limited capacity.",
        "It is too vague and simplistic.",
        "It is well-supported by empirical evidence.",
        "It cannot be tested effectively."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the central executive is too vague and simplistic, making it difficult to design tasks to test its functions. This corresponds to: It is too vague and simplistic.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which component of the WMM was added by Baddeley in 2000 to enhance the model?",
      "options": [
        "Phonological loop",
        "Visuo-spatial sketchpad",
        "Episodic buffer",
        "Central executive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The episodic buffer was added to the working memory model by Baddeley in 2000 to integrate information from different stores"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study where participants are asked to remember a list of words while solving a puzzle, which aspect of the WMM is being tested?",
      "options": [
        "Capacity of the phonological loop",
        "Function of the visuo-spatial sketchpad",
        "Role of the central executive",
        "Duration of the episodic buffer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario tests the role of the central executive in managing multiple tasks simultaneously"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the working memory model differ from the multi-store model regarding rehearsal?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal is the only process in WMM.",
        "WMM does not emphasize rehearsal as much.",
        "Both models emphasize rehearsal equally.",
        "WMM suggests rehearsal is unnecessary."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The WMM allows for other processes beyond rehearsal to explain how information enters long-term memory, unlike the multi-store model. This corresponds to: WMM does not emphasize rehearsal as much.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with the case study of KF?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks ecological validity.",
        "It is based on a single individual.",
        "It has a large sample size.",
        "It uses quantitative data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "As a case study of a single individual, KF's findings may not be generalizable to the wider population. This corresponds to: It is based on a single individual.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the episodic buffer in the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "It stores visual information.",
        "It integrates information from different stores.",
        "It processes auditory information.",
        "It is the main control system."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The episodic buffer integrates information from the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad, providing a more holistic view of working memory. This corresponds to: It integrates information from different stores.."
