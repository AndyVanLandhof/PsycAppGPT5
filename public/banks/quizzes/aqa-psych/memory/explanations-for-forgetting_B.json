    {
      "question": "What is proactive interference as described in the context of forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "New learning prevents recall of old information",
        "Old learning prevents recall of new information",
        "Cues are absent during recall",
        "Memory traces decay over time"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Proactive interference occurs when old learning interferes with the recall of new information. This corresponds to: Old learning prevents recall of new information."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Martin's case, he confuses the French word for 'chair' with the Spanish word. This scenario exemplifies which type of interference?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Retrieval failure",
        "Trace decay"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Martin's confusion illustrates proactive interference, where old knowledge (French) interferes with new learning (Spanish)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes retrieval failure?",
      "options": [
        "Memories are lost due to decay",
        "Memories cannot be accessed due to lack of cues",
        "New information overwrites old information",
        "Old memories are forgotten due to interference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retrieval failure occurs when information is available but cannot be accessed due to the absence of appropriate cues. This corresponds to: Memories cannot be accessed due to lack of cues."
    },
    {
      "question": "A student studies for a language exam but recalls words from a different language. This is an example of which explanation for forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "Trace decay",
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Cues"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The student's recall of words from a different language demonstrates retroactive interference, where new learning interferes with the recall of previously learned information"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Anderson (2000), what is a limitation of interference theory?",
      "options": [
        "It cannot explain all types of forgetting",
        "It is too simplistic",
        "It requires similar types of information",
        "It is not applicable in everyday situations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Anderson concluded that interference effects require similar types of information, limiting its applicability to everyday forgetting. This corresponds to: It requires similar types of information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do cues play in retrieval failure?",
      "options": [
        "They enhance memory trace decay",
        "They help access memories that are available but not accessible",
        "They prevent proactive interference",
        "They are irrelevant to memory recall"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cues serve as reminders that can help access memories that are available but not accessible, thus reducing retrieval failure. This corresponds to: They help access memories that are available but not accessible."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, participants were unable to recall information due to a lack of environmental cues. This scenario illustrates which explanation for forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retrieval failure",
        "Trace decay",
        "Retroactive interference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The inability to recall information due to a lack of cues exemplifies retrieval failure, where memories are available but not accessible"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a criticism of interference theory?",
      "options": [
        "It is too complex",
        "It does not account for all types of forgetting",
        "It is only applicable in laboratory settings",
        "It overemphasizes the role of cues"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Interference theory is criticized for not accounting for all types of forgetting, as it may not be a significant factor in everyday situations. This corresponds to: It does not account for all types of forgetting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary difference between proactive and retroactive interference?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference involves new information, while retroactive involves old",
        "Proactive interference is about forgetting, while retroactive is about recall",
        "Proactive interference is when old learning affects new, retroactive is the opposite",
        "There is no difference; they are the same"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Proactive interference occurs when old learning affects the recall of new information, while retroactive interference occurs when new learning affects the recall of old information. This corresponds to: Proactive interference is when old learning affects new, retroactive is the opposite."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of forgetting, what is the significance of cues?",
      "options": [
        "They are irrelevant to memory recall",
        "They can enhance the recall of memories",
        "They cause interference",
        "They lead to trace decay"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cues are significant as they can enhance the recall of memories by providing reminders that help access information that is otherwise not retrievable"
