    {
      "question": "What is the main idea behind interference theory as an explanation for forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "Memories decay over time",
        "New information overwrites old information",
        "Memories are lost due to lack of cues",
        "Memories are never stored properly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Interference theory suggests that two sets of information can become confused, leading to forgetting. This corresponds to: New information overwrites old information."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Martin's case, he confuses the French word for 'chair' with the Spanish word for 'chair'. This is an example of which type of interference?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Cue-dependent forgetting",
        "Trace decay"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Martin's confusion illustrates proactive interference, where old learning (French) interferes with new learning (Spanish)"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the retrieval failure theory, what is necessary for successful recall?",
      "options": [
        "The information must be stored in long-term memory",
        "Cues must be present to trigger memory retrieval",
        "Memories must be rehearsed frequently",
        "Memories must be unique and distinct"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retrieval failure theory posits that memories can be available but not accessible without appropriate cues. This corresponds to: Cues must be present to trigger memory retrieval."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of interference theory in explaining everyday forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "It only applies to short-term memory",
        "It requires similar types of information for interference to occur",
        "It does not account for retrieval failure",
        "It is based on outdated research methods"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Interference theory is limited because it typically requires similar types of information, which does not often occur in everyday situations. This corresponds to: It requires similar types of information for interference to occur."
    },
    {
      "question": "Natasha struggles to remember her lines during a performance, recalling lines from a different play instead. This scenario can be explained by which type of interference?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Cue-dependent forgetting",
        "Trace decay"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Natasha's situation exemplifies retroactive interference, where new learning (lines from a different play) interferes with the recall of previously learned material"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes proactive interference?",
      "options": [
        "New information disrupts old information",
        "Old information disrupts new information",
        "Memories fade over time",
        "Cues are absent during recall"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Proactive interference occurs when previously learned information interferes with the recall of new information. This corresponds to: Old information disrupts new information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do cues play in retrieval failure?",
      "options": [
        "They enhance the storage of memories",
        "They are necessary for the initial learning process",
        "They help trigger the recall of memories that are available but not accessible",
        "They prevent interference from occurring"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Cues are essential for triggering the recall of memories that may be available in long-term memory but not easily accessible. This corresponds to: They help trigger the recall of memories that are available but not accessible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a methodological criticism of interference theory?",
      "options": [
        "It relies on self-reported data",
        "It often uses artificial tasks that may not reflect real-life forgetting",
        "It does not consider emotional factors",
        "It assumes all types of memory are equally affected"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Interference theory is criticized for using artificial tasks, which may not accurately reflect how forgetting occurs in real-life situations. This corresponds to: It often uses artificial tasks that may not reflect real-life forgetting."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of forgetting, what does cue-dependent forgetting refer to?",
      "options": [
        "Forgetting due to decay of memory traces",
        "Forgetting due to lack of appropriate retrieval cues",
        "Forgetting due to interference from similar information",
        "Forgetting due to emotional distress"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cue-dependent forgetting occurs when a memory is available but cannot be retrieved due to the absence of appropriate cues. This corresponds to: Forgetting due to lack of appropriate retrieval cues."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key difference between proactive and retroactive interference?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference involves new information, while retroactive involves old",
        "Proactive interference occurs in short-term memory, while retroactive occurs in long-term",
        "Proactive interference is when old information disrupts new, while retroactive is when new disrupts old",
        "There is no difference; they are the same concept"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Proactive interference occurs when old information disrupts the recall of new information, while retroactive interference occurs when new information disrupts the recall of old. This corresponds to: Proactive interference is when old information disrupts new, while retroactive is when new disrupts old."
