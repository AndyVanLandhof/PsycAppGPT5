  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What are the three memory stores identified in the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "Sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory",
        "Short-term memory, working memory, long-term memory",
        "Sensory memory, working memory, episodic memory",
        "Short-term memory, episodic memory, procedural memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model identifies sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory as its three main stores. This corresponds to: Sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the multi-store model, what is the primary process that transfers information from short-term memory to long-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal",
        "Encoding",
        "Retrieval",
        "Storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Rehearsal is the primary process that facilitates the transfer of information from short-term memory to long-term memory in the multi-store model"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher tests participants' short-term memory by asking them to repeat sequences of numbers. What is the likely outcome based on the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "Participants can recall an unlimited number of items",
        "Participants can recall between 5 and 9 items",
        "Participants will forget all items immediately",
        "Participants will recall items in reverse order"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "According to the multi-store model, short-term memory has a limited capacity, typically allowing recall of between 5 and 9 items. This corresponds to: Participants can recall between 5 and 9 items."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which study supports the multi-store model's claim about the capacity of short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "KF by Shallice and Washington (1974)",
        "Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968)",
        "Miller (1956)",
        "Baddeley (1966)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Miller's study (1956) supports the multi-store model by suggesting that the capacity of short-term memory is around 7Â±2 items. This corresponds to: Miller (1956)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Kaleb struggles to recall information about the multi-store model after learning about the working memory model. This is an example of which type of forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Decay",
        "Repression"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Kaleb's difficulty is an example of retroactive interference, where new information (working memory model) interferes with the recall of previously learned information (multi-store model)"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key limitation of the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "It does not account for different types of long-term memory",
        "It overemphasizes the role of rehearsal",
        "It suggests short-term memory is a single store",
        "It lacks empirical support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A key limitation of the multi-store model is that it does not account for the different types of long-term memory, which are better explained by other models. This corresponds to: It does not account for different types of long-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the multi-store model suggest about the encoding of information in short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "Information is encoded visually",
        "Information is encoded semantically",
        "Information is encoded acoustically",
        "Information is encoded through imagery"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model suggests that information in short-term memory is primarily encoded acoustically. This corresponds to: Information is encoded acoustically."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the multi-store model differ from the working memory model in terms of short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "The multi-store model has multiple stores for short-term memory",
        "The working memory model emphasizes rehearsal more",
        "The multi-store model views short-term memory as a single store",
        "The working memory model does not include long-term memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model views short-term memory as a single store, while the working memory model proposes multiple components for processing information"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the multi-store model, what is the role of sensory memory?",
      "options": [
        "To store information for long periods",
        "To hold information briefly for processing",
        "To encode information semantically",
        "To retrieve information from long-term memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Sensory memory holds information briefly for processing before it is either forgotten or transferred to short-term memory. This corresponds to: To hold information briefly for processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "It relies heavily on case studies",
        "It is based on self-report data",
        "It lacks ecological validity",
        "It does not consider emotional factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model relies heavily on case studies, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of memory processes in the general population. This corresponds to: It relies heavily on case studies."
