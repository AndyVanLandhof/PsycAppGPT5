    {
      "question": "What are the three memory stores identified in the multi-store model of memory proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968?",
      "options": [
        "Sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory",
        "Short-term memory, working memory, long-term memory",
        "Sensory memory, working memory, episodic memory",
        "Short-term memory, episodic memory, procedural memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model identifies sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory as its three main stores. This corresponds to: Sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study testing short-term memory, participants were asked to repeat sequences of numbers. What was the likely outcome regarding the capacity of short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "Participants could recall up to 3 items",
        "Participants could recall up to 5-9 items",
        "Participants could recall an unlimited number of items",
        "Participants could recall only 1 item"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "According to the multi-store model, the capacity of short-term memory is typically between 5 and 9 items. This corresponds to: Participants could recall up to 5-9 items."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the process of transferring information from short-term memory to long-term memory in the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal",
        "Encoding",
        "Retrieval",
        "Storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Rehearsal is the process that helps transfer information from short-term memory to long-term memory in the multi-store model"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the multi-store model of memory explain the process of forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "Through interference",
        "Through decay",
        "Through retrieval failure",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model suggests that forgetting can occur through interference, decay, and retrieval failure. This corresponds to: All of the above."
    },
    {
      "question": "A student struggles to recall the multi-store model after learning about the working memory model. Which explanation for forgetting could apply to this situation?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Decay",
        "Rehearsal failure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retroactive interference occurs when new information (working memory model) interferes with the recall of previously learned information (multi-store model)"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key limitation of the multi-store model of memory regarding its explanation of short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "It does not account for different types of short-term memory",
        "It overemphasizes the role of rehearsal",
        "It lacks empirical support",
        "It does not explain long-term memory processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model is criticized for not accounting for the different types of short-term memory, as shown by studies like KF. This corresponds to: It does not account for different types of short-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements about the multi-store model is true?",
      "options": [
        "It suggests that short-term memory is a single store",
        "It emphasizes the role of the central executive",
        "It includes the episodic buffer as a component",
        "It was developed after the working memory model"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model suggests that short-term memory is a single store, unlike the working memory model which includes multiple components. This corresponds to: It suggests that short-term memory is a single store."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the multi-store model, what is the primary function of sensory memory?",
      "options": [
        "To hold information for a long duration",
        "To process and encode information",
        "To briefly retain information from the environment",
        "To retrieve information from long-term memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Sensory memory's primary function is to briefly retain information from the environment before it is processed further"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often raised regarding the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "It relies too heavily on case studies",
        "It does not consider emotional factors",
        "It lacks a clear definition of memory stores",
        "It is based on outdated technology"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the multi-store model relies too heavily on case studies, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of memory processes. This corresponds to: It relies too heavily on case studies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a key feature of the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "It includes the episodic buffer",
        "It describes memory as a series of stages",
        "It emphasizes the role of working memory",
        "It suggests that memory is a dynamic process"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model describes memory as a series of stages, including sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. This corresponds to: It describes memory as a series of stages."
