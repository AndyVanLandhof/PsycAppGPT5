    {
      "question": "What are the three memory stores identified in the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "Sensory memory, Short-term memory, Long-term memory",
        "Working memory, Short-term memory, Long-term memory",
        "Sensory memory, Working memory, Long-term memory",
        "Short-term memory, Long-term memory, Procedural memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model identifies sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory as its three key stores. This corresponds to: Sensory memory, Short-term memory, Long-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the multi-store model, what is the primary process that transfers information from short-term memory to long-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal",
        "Encoding",
        "Retrieval",
        "Storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Rehearsal is the primary process that facilitates the transfer of information from short-term memory to long-term memory in the multi-store model"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher tests participants' short-term memory by asking them to repeat back sequences of numbers. What is the likely outcome based on the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "Participants will recall all numbers correctly",
        "Participants will recall between 5 and 9 items correctly",
        "Participants will recall only one number correctly",
        "Participants will recall no numbers correctly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "According to the multi-store model, the capacity of short-term memory is typically between 5 and 9 items, which aligns with the expected outcome of this research. This corresponds to: Participants will recall between 5 and 9 items correctly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which psychologist(s) first proposed the multi-store model of memory in 1968?",
      "options": [
        "Baddeley and Hitch",
        "Shallice and Washington",
        "Atkinson and Shiffrin",
        "Miller"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model was first described by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968. This corresponds to: Atkinson and Shiffrin."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the multi-store model of memory differ from the working memory model in terms of short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "It has multiple stores",
        "It emphasizes rehearsal",
        "It includes a central executive",
        "It does not involve encoding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model emphasizes rehearsal as a key process, unlike the working memory model, which includes multiple stores and processes. This corresponds to: It emphasizes rehearsal."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study of short-term memory, participants were asked to recall a list of words immediately after hearing them. What aspect of the multi-store model does this research primarily investigate?",
      "options": [
        "The encoding process",
        "The capacity of short-term memory",
        "The retrieval process",
        "The duration of long-term memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This research primarily investigates the capacity of short-term memory, as participants are recalling information immediately after presentation"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the multi-store model regarding its explanation of memory processes?",
      "options": [
        "It does not account for long-term memory",
        "It oversimplifies the process of memory",
        "It does not include sensory memory",
        "It is based on outdated research"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A limitation of the multi-store model is that it oversimplifies the memory process by treating short-term memory as a single store. This corresponds to: It oversimplifies the process of memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of memory does the multi-store model primarily focus on?",
      "options": [
        "Long-term memory",
        "Sensory memory",
        "Short-term memory",
        "Working memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model primarily focuses on short-term memory as one of its key components"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a key feature of the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "It includes a central executive",
        "It describes memory as a single store",
        "It suggests that memory processes are sequential",
        "It emphasizes the role of visual memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model suggests that memory processes occur in a sequential manner, moving from sensory memory to short-term memory and then to long-term memory. This corresponds to: It suggests that memory processes are sequential."
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence does the case study of KF provide in relation to the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "It supports the idea of a single short-term memory store",
        "It demonstrates the capacity of long-term memory",
        "It suggests multiple stores within short-term memory",
        "It shows that rehearsal is essential for memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The case study of KF suggests multiple stores within short-term memory, as he had an impaired articulatory loop but an intact visuo-spatial sketchpad. This corresponds to: It suggests multiple stores within short-term memory."
