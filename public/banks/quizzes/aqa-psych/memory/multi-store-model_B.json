    {
      "question": "What are the three main stores in the multi-store model of memory as proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968?",
      "options": [
        "Sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory",
        "Working memory, sensory memory, long-term memory",
        "Short-term memory, episodic memory, procedural memory",
        "Sensory memory, working memory, procedural memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model consists of sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. This corresponds to: Sensory memory, short-term memory, long-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study testing the capacity of short-term memory, participants were asked to recall sequences of numbers. What was the expected outcome based on the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "Participants would recall all sequences correctly",
        "Participants would recall sequences of 5 to 9 items correctly",
        "Participants would recall only the first number in each sequence",
        "Participants would struggle with any sequence longer than 3 numbers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "According to the multi-store model, short-term memory has a limited capacity of between 5 and 9 items. This corresponds to: Participants would recall sequences of 5 to 9 items correctly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the process of transferring information from short-term memory to long-term memory in the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal",
        "Encoding",
        "Retrieval",
        "Storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Rehearsal is the process that helps transfer information from short-term memory to long-term memory"
    },
    {
      "question": "What limitation does the multi-store model of memory have regarding the nature of short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "It does not account for the role of rehearsal",
        "It suggests short-term memory is a single store",
        "It ignores sensory memory",
        "It does not explain long-term memory retrieval"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model suggests short-term memory is a single store, which is a limitation as it does not account for different types of short-term memory. This corresponds to: It suggests short-term memory is a single store."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the multi-store model, what is the primary method of coding in short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "Visual",
        "Acoustic",
        "Semantic",
        "Tactile"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Short-term memory primarily codes information acoustically, as suggested by the multi-store model"
    },
    {
      "question": "Kaleb is struggling to recall information about the multi-store model after learning about the working memory model. Which type of interference might explain his difficulty?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Contextual interference",
        "Semantic interference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retroactive interference occurs when new information (working memory model) interferes with the recall of previously learned information (multi-store model)"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the multi-store model of memory differ from the working memory model in terms of short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "The multi-store model has multiple stores for short-term memory",
        "The working memory model emphasizes rehearsal more",
        "The multi-store model treats short-term memory as a single store",
        "The working memory model does not include long-term memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model treats short-term memory as a single store, whereas the working memory model includes multiple components"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of rehearsal in the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "It is essential for encoding information into sensory memory",
        "It is the only method for transferring information to long-term memory",
        "It helps maintain information in short-term memory",
        "It has no role in memory processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Rehearsal helps maintain information in short-term memory, allowing it to be transferred to long-term memory. This corresponds to: It helps maintain information in short-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements about the multi-store model is true?",
      "options": [
        "It suggests that memory is a single process",
        "It includes sensory, short-term, and long-term memory stores",
        "It was proposed by Baddeley and Hitch",
        "It emphasizes the importance of visual coding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model includes sensory, short-term, and long-term memory stores as its key components. This corresponds to: It includes sensory, short-term, and long-term memory stores."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks empirical support",
        "It oversimplifies the complexity of memory processes",
        "It does not consider individual differences",
        "It is based solely on case studies"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model oversimplifies the complexity of memory processes by treating them as linear and discrete. This corresponds to: It oversimplifies the complexity of memory processes."
