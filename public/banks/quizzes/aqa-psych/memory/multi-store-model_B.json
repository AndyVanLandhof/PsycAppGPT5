    {
      "question": "What are the three main stores in the multi-store model of memory as proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968?",
      "options": [
        "Sensory memory, Short-term memory, Long-term memory",
        "Sensory memory, Working memory, Long-term memory",
        "Short-term memory, Working memory, Long-term memory",
        "Sensory memory, Short-term memory, Working memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model consists of sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory as its three main stores. This corresponds to: Sensory memory, Short-term memory, Long-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study testing the capacity of short-term memory, participants were asked to repeat sequences of numbers. What was the expected outcome according to the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "Participants would recall all numbers correctly",
        "Participants would recall between 5 and 9 items correctly",
        "Participants would recall only the first number",
        "Participants would recall only the last number"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "According to the multi-store model, short-term memory has a limited capacity of between 5 and 9 items. This corresponds to: Participants would recall between 5 and 9 items correctly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the process of transferring information from short-term memory to long-term memory in the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "Rehearsal",
        "Retrieval",
        "Encoding",
        "Storage"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Rehearsal is the process that helps transfer information from short-term memory to long-term memory in the multi-store model"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with the multi-store model of memory?",
      "options": [
        "It does not account for different types of long-term memory",
        "It relies solely on case studies",
        "It does not consider the role of emotions in memory",
        "It assumes memory processes are linear"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model has been criticized for not accounting for different types of long-term memory, such as episodic and semantic memory. This corresponds to: It does not account for different types of long-term memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key limitation of the multi-store model when compared to the working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "It does not include a central executive",
        "It does not explain long-term memory",
        "It does not consider visual information",
        "It does not involve rehearsal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model does not include a central executive, which is a key component of the working memory model. This corresponds to: It does not include a central executive."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the multi-store model, what type of coding is primarily used in short-term memory?",
      "options": [
        "Visual coding",
        "Acoustic coding",
        "Semantic coding",
        "Tactile coding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Short-term memory primarily uses acoustic coding, as information is often rehearsed verbally"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the multi-store model, what is the role of sensory memory?",
      "options": [
        "To store information for long periods",
        "To hold information temporarily before it is processed",
        "To retrieve information from long-term memory",
        "To encode information into short-term memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Sensory memory holds information temporarily before it is processed into short-term memory. This corresponds to: To hold information temporarily before it is processed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What evidence from the case study of KF supports the working memory model over the multi-store model?",
      "options": [
        "KF had intact long-term memory",
        "KF could recall visual information but not verbal information",
        "KF had no short-term memory",
        "KF could rehearse information effectively"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "KF's ability to recall visual information but not verbal information supports the working memory model's idea of multiple stores in short-term memory. This corresponds to: KF could recall visual information but not verbal information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a significant feature of the multi-store model regarding the flow of information?",
      "options": [
        "Information flows in a circular manner",
        "Information flows in a linear sequence",
        "Information is processed simultaneously",
        "Information is stored indefinitely"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model describes information flow in a linear sequence from sensory memory to short-term memory and then to long-term memory. This corresponds to: Information flows in a linear sequence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What aspect of memory does the multi-store model primarily focus on?",
      "options": [
        "Long-term memory processes",
        "Short-term memory processes",
        "Working memory processes",
        "Sensory memory processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The multi-store model primarily focuses on short-term memory processes and how they relate to long-term memory"
