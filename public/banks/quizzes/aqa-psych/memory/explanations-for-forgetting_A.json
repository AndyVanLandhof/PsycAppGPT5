    {
      "question": "What is proactive interference as described in the context of memory?",
      "options": [
        "When new information prevents the recall of old information",
        "When old information prevents the recall of new information",
        "When information is lost due to decay over time",
        "When cues are absent during recall"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Proactive interference occurs when old learning interferes with the recall of more recent information. This corresponds to: When old information prevents the recall of new information."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Martin's case, he confuses the French word for 'chair' with the Spanish word. This scenario illustrates which type of interference?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Cue-dependent forgetting",
        "Trace decay"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Martin's confusion between the two languages exemplifies proactive interference, where old learning (French) affects new learning (Spanish)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes retrieval failure?",
      "options": [
        "The memory trace has disappeared",
        "Old information prevents recall of new information",
        "Information is available but not accessible due to absence of cues",
        "New information overwrites old information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Retrieval failure occurs when information is available in memory but cannot be accessed due to a lack of appropriate cues. This corresponds to: Information is available but not accessible due to absence of cues."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do cues play in retrieval failure?",
      "options": [
        "They enhance the decay of memory traces",
        "They provide reminders that facilitate recall",
        "They overwrite old memories",
        "They have no effect on memory retrieval"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cues serve as reminders that can help facilitate the recall of information that is otherwise inaccessible. This corresponds to: They provide reminders that facilitate recall."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Anderson (2000), how significant is interference in everyday forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "It is the primary cause of all forgetting",
        "It plays a role but is relatively unimportant",
        "It is the only explanation for forgetting",
        "It is more significant than retrieval failure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Anderson concluded that while interference does contribute to forgetting, it is not the most significant factor in everyday situations. This corresponds to: It plays a role but is relatively unimportant."
    },
    {
      "question": "Natasha struggles to remember her lines during her drama performance, instead recalling lines from a different play. This scenario can be explained by which type of interference?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Cue-dependent forgetting",
        "Trace decay"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Natasha's recall of lines from a different play illustrates retroactive interference, where new learning (current play) interferes with the recall of previously learned material (old play)"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with research on interference as an explanation for forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "Interference effects are common in everyday life",
        "Interference requires similar types of information to occur",
        "Interference is always the primary cause of forgetting",
        "Interference is easy to replicate in laboratory settings"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Research indicates that interference effects are less common in everyday life, as they typically require similar types of information to lead to forgetting. This corresponds to: Interference requires similar types of information to occur."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between retrieval failure and cues?",
      "options": [
        "Cues are irrelevant to memory retrieval",
        "Cues can enhance memory decay",
        "Cues can aid in accessing memories that are available but not retrievable",
        "Cues always guarantee successful recall"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Cues can help access memories that are available but not retrievable, highlighting the importance of context in memory recall. This corresponds to: Cues can aid in accessing memories that are available but not retrievable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the interference theory in explaining forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "It does not account for all types of forgetting",
        "It is too simplistic",
        "It cannot explain retrieval failure",
        "It is only applicable in laboratory settings"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Interference theory does not account for all types of forgetting, suggesting that other explanations, such as retrieval failure, are also necessary. This corresponds to: It does not account for all types of forgetting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of interference occurs when new learning disrupts the recall of previously learned information?",
      "options": [
        "Proactive interference",
        "Retroactive interference",
        "Cue-dependent forgetting",
        "Trace decay"
