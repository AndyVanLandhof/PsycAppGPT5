    {
      "question": "What does interference theory suggest about forgetting?",
      "options": [
        "A) It occurs due to the decay of memory traces.",
        "B) It is caused by the confusion between similar sets of information.",
        "C) It is primarily due to the absence of retrieval cues.",
        "D) It is a result of emotional state during recall."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Interference theory posits that forgetting occurs when two sets of information become confused, particularly when they are similar. This corresponds to: B) It is caused by the confusion between similar sets of information.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Martin's case, he confuses the French word for 'chair' with the Spanish word. This is an example of which type of interference?",
      "options": [
        "A) Proactive interference",
        "B) Retroactive interference",
        "C) Cue-dependent forgetting",
        "D) Trace decay"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Martin's confusion illustrates proactive interference, where old learning (French) interferes with the recall of new information (Spanish). This corresponds to: A) Proactive interference."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is retrieval failure in the context of memory?",
      "options": [
        "A) The inability to store information in long-term memory.",
        "B) The inability to access a memory due to absent cues.",
        "C) The overwriting of old memories with new information.",
        "D) The decay of memory traces over time."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retrieval failure occurs when information is available in memory but cannot be accessed due to the absence of appropriate cues. This corresponds to: B) The inability to access a memory due to absent cues.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Natasha struggles to remember her lines during her drama performance, recalling lines from a different play instead. This scenario can be explained by which theory?",
      "options": [
        "A) Trace decay theory",
        "B) Proactive interference",
        "C) Retroactive interference",
        "D) Cue-dependent forgetting"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Natasha's recall of lines from a different play suggests proactive interference, where previously learned material interferes with the recall of new material. This corresponds to: B) Proactive interference."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of interference theory?",
      "options": [
        "A) It cannot explain all instances of forgetting.",
        "B) It is only applicable to verbal information.",
        "C) It suggests that all memories are equally susceptible to interference.",
        "D) It does not account for emotional factors in memory."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A limitation of interference theory is that it cannot explain all instances of forgetting, as it requires specific conditions for interference to occur. This corresponds to: A) It cannot explain all instances of forgetting.."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the retrieval failure theory, what can help improve recall?",
      "options": [
        "A) Studying in a different environment from where the material was learned.",
        "B) Using cues that are contextually linked to the material.",
        "C) Increasing the amount of information learned.",
        "D) Reducing the emotional state during recall."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retrieval failure theory suggests that using cues that are contextually linked to the material can significantly improve recall. This corresponds to: B) Using cues that are contextually linked to the material.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes retroactive interference?",
      "options": [
        "A) Old information prevents the recall of new information.",
        "B) New information prevents the recall of old information.",
        "C) Information is lost due to decay over time.",
        "D) Information is forgotten due to lack of rehearsal."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retroactive interference occurs when new learning interferes with the recall of previously learned information. This corresponds to: B) New information prevents the recall of old information.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of memory, what role do cues play in retrieval failure?",
      "options": [
        "A) They enhance the decay of memory traces.",
        "B) They provide reminders that facilitate recall.",
        "C) They prevent proactive interference.",
        "D) They are irrelevant to memory retrieval."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cues serve as reminders that can facilitate the recall of memories that are otherwise inaccessible due to retrieval failure. This corresponds to: B) They provide reminders that facilitate recall.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with studies on interference theory?",
      "options": [
        "A) They often use artificial tasks that lack ecological validity.",
        "B) They do not consider emotional factors in memory.",
        "C) They rely solely on self-reported data.",
        "D) They fail to differentiate between types of memory."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A methodological issue with studies on interference theory is that they often use artificial tasks, which may lack ecological validity and not reflect real-life memory use. This corresponds to: A) They often use artificial tasks that lack ecological validity.."
