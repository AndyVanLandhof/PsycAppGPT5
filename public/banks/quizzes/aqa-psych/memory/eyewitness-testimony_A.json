    {
      "question": "What did Loftus and Palmer (1974) find regarding the impact of leading questions on eyewitness testimony?",
      "options": [
        "Participants estimated higher speeds with the word 'smashed'",
        "Participants recalled more details with the word 'hit'",
        "Participants were less confident with leading questions",
        "Participants showed no difference in speed estimates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The study showed that the wording of questions significantly influenced speed estimates, with 'smashed' leading to higher estimates. This corresponds to: Participants estimated higher speeds with the word 'smashed'."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of eyewitness testimony, what is meant by 'post-event discussion'?",
      "options": [
        "A conversation that occurs before the event",
        "An interview conducted by police",
        "A conversation between witnesses after the event",
        "A method to enhance memory recall"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Post-event discussion refers to conversations between co-witnesses or interviewers that can alter a witness's memory. This corresponds to: A conversation between witnesses after the event."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does anxiety affect eyewitness testimony according to research?",
      "options": [
        "It always improves recall accuracy",
        "It has no effect on memory",
        "It can lead to physiological arousal that may impair memory",
        "It only affects children"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Research indicates that anxiety can lead to physiological arousal, which may impair the accuracy of eyewitness memory. This corresponds to: It can lead to physiological arousal that may impair memory."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a witness is asked leading questions, what is a potential outcome?",
      "options": [
        "The witness will always remember correctly",
        "The witness's memory may be altered",
        "The witness will provide more details",
        "The witness will forget the event entirely"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Leading questions can introduce misleading information that alters the witness's memory of the event. This corresponds to: The witness's memory may be altered."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one criticism of Loftus and Palmer's (1974) study regarding ecological validity?",
      "options": [
        "The study used real-life witnesses",
        "The video of a car crash may not evoke real emotional responses",
        "Participants were not aware of the study's aims",
        "The sample size was too large"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The use of a video may lack the emotional intensity of a real car crash, affecting the generalizability of the findings. This corresponds to: The video of a car crash may not evoke real emotional responses."

    {
      "question": "Which technique is NOT part of the cognitive interview?",
      "options": [
        "Changing perspective",
        "Report everything",
        "Leading questions",
        "Context reinstatement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Leading questions are not part of the cognitive interview; instead, techniques aim to enhance memory recall"
    },
    {
      "question": "What effect can misleading information have on eyewitness testimony?",
      "options": [
        "It can enhance memory recall",
        "It can lead to memory contamination",
        "It has no effect on memory",
        "It only affects children"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Misleading information can contaminate a witness's memory, leading to inaccuracies in their testimony. This corresponds to: It can lead to memory contamination."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential methodological issue with studies on eyewitness testimony?",
      "options": [
        "They often use real-life scenarios",
        "They may involve demand characteristics",
        "They always have a large sample size",
        "They do not use leading questions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Participants may guess the aims of the study, leading to demand characteristics that can skew results. This corresponds to: They may involve demand characteristics."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the cognitive interview aim to improve eyewitness testimony?",
      "options": [
        "By using leading questions",
        "By encouraging witnesses to recall everything",
        "By limiting the amount of information shared",
        "By avoiding any discussion with witnesses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cognitive interview encourages witnesses to report everything they remember, which can improve the accuracy of their testimony. This corresponds to: By encouraging witnesses to recall everything."

    {
      "question": "What is one way that anxiety can impact eyewitness memory according to research?",
      "options": [
        "It always enhances memory recall",
        "It can lead to physiological arousal that may impair memory",
        "It has no measurable effects",
        "It only affects adults"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Anxiety can cause physiological arousal, which may negatively impact the accuracy of eyewitness memory. This corresponds to: It can lead to physiological arousal that may impair memory."
