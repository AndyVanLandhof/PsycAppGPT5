      "question": "What did Loftus and Palmer (1974) find regarding the impact of leading questions on eyewitness testimony?",
      "options": [
        "Participants estimated higher speeds with the word 'smashed'",
        "Participants recalled more details with the word 'contacted'",
        "Participants were less confident with leading questions",
        "Participants showed no difference in speed estimates"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Loftus and Palmer found that the wording of leading questions significantly influenced participants' speed estimates, with 'smashed' leading to higher estimates. This corresponds to: Participants estimated higher speeds with the word 'smashed'."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The type of question asked influenced participants' recollection, demonstrating how leading questions can alter memory"
