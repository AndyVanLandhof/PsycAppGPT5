    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a key characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?",
      "options": [
        "Compulsions to avoid social situations",
        "Persistent intrusive thoughts",
        "Extreme mood swings",
        "Loss of interest in activities"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "OCD is characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) aimed at reducing anxiety"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Nestadt et al.'s (2000) study, what was found regarding first-degree relatives of patients with OCD?",
      "options": [
        "They have a lower risk of developing OCD",
        "They have a five-times greater risk of developing OCD",
        "They have no increased risk of developing OCD",
        "They have a higher risk of developing depression only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Nestadt et al. found that individuals with a first-degree relative with OCD had a five-times greater risk of developing the disorder themselves. This corresponds to: They have a five-times greater risk of developing OCD."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary focus of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating OCD?",
      "options": [
        "Increasing serotonin levels",
        "Challenging irrational thoughts",
        "Flooding patients with anxiety-provoking stimuli",
        "Reinforcing compulsive behaviors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "CBT for OCD focuses on challenging irrational thoughts and beliefs that contribute to obsessive-compulsive behaviors"
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with OCD is treated using exposure and response prevention (ERP). What is the main goal of this treatment?",
      "options": [
        "To increase serotonin levels",
        "To prevent the performance of compulsive behaviors",
        "To reinforce avoidance of anxiety-provoking stimuli",
        "To eliminate all obsessive thoughts"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "ERP aims to expose patients to their feared stimuli while preventing them from engaging in compulsive behaviors, helping to reduce anxiety over time. This corresponds to: To prevent the performance of compulsive behaviors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of the genetic explanation for OCD?",
      "options": [
        "It does not account for environmental factors",
        "It is the only explanation for OCD",
        "It has 100% concordance rates in identical twins",
        "It is not supported by empirical evidence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A limitation is that the genetic explanation does not account for environmental factors, as evidenced by the fact that concordance rates are never 100%. This corresponds to: It does not account for environmental factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the two-process model, how does an obsession in OCD typically develop?",
      "options": [
        "Through genetic predisposition",
        "By associating a neutral stimulus with anxiety",
        "By increasing serotonin levels",
        "Through social learning from peers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The two-process model suggests that an obsession develops when a neutral stimulus becomes associated with anxiety, leading to compulsive behaviors. This corresponds to: By associating a neutral stimulus with anxiety."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a common side effect of drug treatments for OCD?",
      "options": [
        "Increased anxiety",
        "Weight gain",
        "Nausea",
        "Improved social interactions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Common side effects of drug treatments for OCD, particularly SSRIs, can include nausea among other physical symptoms"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is associated with studies on the genetic basis of OCD?",
      "options": [
        "They often lack control groups",
        "They rely solely on self-reported data",
        "They do not consider the role of environmental factors",
        "They are conducted only on children"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A methodological issue is that many studies do not consider the role of environmental factors, which can also contribute to the development of OCD. This corresponds to: They do not consider the role of environmental factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of serotonin in the biological explanation of OCD?",
      "options": [
        "It is always elevated in patients with OCD",
        "It is linked to the development of compulsive behaviors",
        "Low levels of serotonin are associated with OCD",
        "It has no impact on OCD symptoms"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The biological explanation suggests that low levels of serotonin are associated with OCD, leading to the use of SSRIs to increase serotonin levels"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which treatment for OCD involves the use of a hierarchy of fears?",
      "options": [
        "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy",
        "Exposure and Response Prevention",
        "Systematic Desensitization",
        "Drug Therapy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Systematic desensitization involves creating a hierarchy of fears and gradually exposing the patient to these fears while teaching relaxation techniques"
