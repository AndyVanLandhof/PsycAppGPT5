      "question": "Which of the following is a cognitive characteristic of OCD?",

        "Avoidance of social situations",
        "Loss of interest in activities"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Intrusive thoughts are a key cognitive characteristic of OCD, where individuals experience unwanted and distressing thoughts"

    {
      "question": "In Nestadt et al.'s 2000 study, what was the increased risk of developing OCD for individuals with a first-degree relative who has the disorder?",
      "options": [
        "Two times greater",
        "Three times greater",
        "Five times greater",
        "Ten times greater"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Nestadt et al. found that individuals with a first-degree relative with OCD had a five-times greater risk of developing the disorder. This corresponds to: Five times greater."

    {
      "question": "What is the primary treatment approach for OCD based on the biological explanation?",
      "options": [
        "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy",
        "Exposure and Response Prevention",
        "Drug therapy",
        "Systematic desensitisation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Drug therapy is a primary treatment for OCD based on the biological explanation, often involving medications that affect serotonin levels"
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with OCD is treated using exposure and response prevention (ERP). What does this treatment involve?",
      "options": [
        "Avoiding triggers of anxiety",
        "Gradually exposing the patient to feared stimuli while preventing compulsive responses",
        "Using medication to increase serotonin levels",
        "Challenging irrational thoughts"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "ERP involves exposing the patient to their feared stimuli while preventing them from performing their compulsive behaviors. This corresponds to: Gradually exposing the patient to feared stimuli while preventing compulsive responses."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes Beck's negative triad in relation to depression?",
      "options": [

        "Increased serotonin levels",
        "Avoidance of social situations",
        "Compulsive behaviors to reduce anxiety"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Beck's negative triad describes a pattern of negative thinking about oneself, the world, and the future, which is central to his cognitive theory of depression. This corresponds to: Negative thoughts about self, world, and future."
    },
    {
      "question": "A meta-analysis of twin studies found that identical twins are more likely to both develop OCD than non-identical twins. What does this suggest?",
      "options": [
        "OCD is purely environmental",
        "OCD has a genetic component",
        "OCD is solely a learned behavior",
        "OCD is not influenced by genetics"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The higher concordance rates in identical twins suggest that there is a genetic component to OCD. This corresponds to: OCD has a genetic component."
    },
    {
      "question": "One limitation of the biological explanation of OCD is that it does not account for which of the following?",
      "options": [
        "Environmental factors",
        "Genetic predispositions",
        "Neural mechanisms",
        "Serotonin levels"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The biological explanation does not fully account for environmental factors, as evidenced by the fact that concordance rates are never 100%"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which treatment for OCD is based on the cognitive approach and involves challenging irrational thoughts?",
      "options": [
        "Flooding",
        "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy",
        "Systematic desensitisation",
        "Drug therapy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) involves challenging irrational thoughts and is a key treatment for OCD from a cognitive perspective"

    {
      "question": "In the context of OCD, what does the term 'diathesis-stress model' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental stressors",
        "The effectiveness of drug therapy",
        "The role of cognitive distortions",
        "The process of systematic desensitisation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The diathesis-stress model refers to the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental stressors in the development of OCD"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with studies supporting the genetic basis of OCD?",
      "options": [
        "They often lack control groups",
        "They do not consider environmental factors",
        "They are based solely on self-reports",
        "They have small sample sizes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Many studies supporting the genetic basis of OCD do not adequately consider environmental factors, which may also contribute to the disorder. This corresponds to: They do not consider environmental factors."
