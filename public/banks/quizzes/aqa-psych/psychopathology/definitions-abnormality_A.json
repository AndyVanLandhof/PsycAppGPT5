        "Failure to function adequately",
        "Deviation from ideal mental health"

      "question": "What is a key characteristic of the 'deviation from ideal mental health' definition of abnormality?",
      "options": [
        "It focuses on statistical rarity",
        "It emphasizes cultural context",
        "It identifies specific criteria for mental well-being",
        "It considers social norms"
      ],

        "It can label high-functioning individuals as abnormal",
        "It is too subjective",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Statistical infrequency may label individuals who are high-functioning but exhibit rare traits as abnormal, which can be misleading. This corresponds to: It can label high-functioning individuals as abnormal."
