    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of phobias?",
      "options": [
        "Intense fear of a specific object",
        "Avoidance of the feared object",
        "Feeling of euphoria when exposed to the object",
        "High levels of anxiety"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Phobias are characterized by intense fear, avoidance, and anxiety, not euphoria. This corresponds to: Feeling of euphoria when exposed to the object."

      "question": "According to the two-process model, which type of conditioning is primarily involved in the acquisition of phobias?",
      "options": [
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Observational learning",
        "Cognitive conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The two-process model states that phobias are acquired through classical conditioning"

    {
      "question": "In systematic desensitisation, what technique is used to help patients manage anxiety?",
      "options": [
        "Flooding",
        "Relaxation techniques",
        "Aversion therapy",
        "Cognitive restructuring"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Systematic desensitisation involves teaching relaxation techniques to manage anxiety"
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with a phobia of spiders is gradually exposed to pictures of spiders, then videos, and finally real spiders. This treatment is an example of:?",
      "options": [
        "Flooding",
        "Cognitive Behaviour Therapy",
        "Systematic desensitisation",
        "Operant conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This gradual exposure aligns with the principles of systematic desensitisation"
    },
    {
      "question": "Zinbarg et al (1992) found that systematic desensitisation was the most effective treatment for phobias. What is a potential limitation of this finding?",
      "options": [
        "It only applies to specific phobias",
        "It lacks a control group",
        "It may not be effective for all individuals",
        "It is too expensive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "While effective, systematic desensitisation may not work for everyone, limiting its generalizability. This corresponds to: It may not be effective for all individuals."

      "question": "A child develops a fear of dogs after being bitten. This fear can be explained by which of the following?",

        "Social learning theory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The child's fear is a result of classical conditioning, where the dog (neutral stimulus) becomes associated with fear (unconditioned response)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes flooding as a treatment for phobias?",
      "options": [
        "Gradual exposure to feared stimuli",
        "Immediate exposure to the feared object",
        "Cognitive restructuring of irrational thoughts",
        "Use of relaxation techniques"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Flooding involves immediate and intense exposure to the feared object or situation. This corresponds to: Immediate exposure to the feared object."

    {
      "question": "A therapist uses flooding to treat a patient with a phobia of heights. What is a potential ethical concern associated with this method?",
      "options": [
        "It is too time-consuming",

      "correctAnswer": 1,

        "A type of cognitive therapy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A fear hierarchy is a ranking of feared stimuli used in systematic desensitisation. This corresponds to: A ranking of feared objects from least to most frightening."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a cognitive characteristic of phobias?",
      "options": [
        "Avoidance behavior",
        "Intense fear response",
