      "question": "In systematic desensitisation, what is the purpose of the fear hierarchy?",
      "options": [
        "To expose the patient to their phobia immediately",
        "To gradually expose the patient to increasing levels of fear",
        "To eliminate all fears at once",
        "To assess the patient's initial anxiety level"

      "question": "A patient with arachnophobia is shown pictures of spiders, then videos, and finally a live spider. This treatment method is an example of:?",

      "question": "Zinbarg et al (1992) found that systematic desensitisation was the most effective treatment for phobias. What is a potential limitation of this finding?",

        "It lacks ecological validity",
        "It is not applicable to all phobias",
        "It relies solely on cognitive techniques",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The effectiveness of systematic desensitisation may vary across different types of phobias. This corresponds to: It is not applicable to all phobias."
