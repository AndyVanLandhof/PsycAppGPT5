      "options": [
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Social learning",
        "Cognitive conditioning"
      ],

    },
    {
      "question": "In systematic desensitisation, what is the purpose of the fear hierarchy?",
      "options": [
        "To gradually expose the patient to their fear",
        "To eliminate all fears at once",
        "To assess the severity of the phobia",
        "To measure the patient's anxiety levels"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The fear hierarchy is used to gradually expose the patient to their fear, starting from the least anxiety-provoking situation"

    {
      "question": "Zinbarg et al (1992) found that which treatment was the most effective for phobias?",

        "Medication"

      "question": "A patient with arachnophobia is treated using flooding. What is the main principle behind this treatment?",
      "options": [
        "Gradual exposure to the fear",
        "Immediate exposure to the fear",
        "Cognitive restructuring",
        "Relaxation techniques"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Flooding involves immediate exposure to the feared object, which aims to reduce anxiety through prolonged confrontation"
    },

      "question": "A child develops a fear of dogs after being bitten. This is an example of which type of conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Social learning",
        "Cognitive conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates classical conditioning, where the child associates dogs with the painful experience of being bitten"
    },
    {
      "question": "A therapist uses systematic desensitisation to treat a patient with a fear of heights. What is the first step in this treatment?",
      "options": [
        "Introducing the patient to heights",
        "Teaching relaxation techniques",
        "Creating a fear hierarchy",
        "Using flooding techniques"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The first step in systematic desensitisation is teaching the patient relaxation techniques to manage anxiety. This corresponds to: Teaching relaxation techniques."

    {
      "question": "One criticism of flooding as a treatment for phobias is that it can cause what?",
      "options": [
        "Immediate relief",
        "Emotional distress",
        "Long-term effectiveness",
        "Cognitive restructuring"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Flooding can cause significant emotional distress, which raises ethical concerns about its use"

    {
      "question": "When comparing systematic desensitisation and flooding, which treatment is generally considered more ethical?",
      "options": [
        "Flooding",
        "Systematic desensitisation",
        "Both are equally ethical",
        "Neither is ethical"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Systematic desensitisation is generally considered more ethical as it involves gradual exposure rather than immediate confrontation"

    {
      "question": "In the context of phobias, what does operant conditioning refer to?",
      "options": [
        "Learning through association",

        "Learning through cognitive processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Operant conditioning involves learning through reinforcement and punishment, which can influence the maintenance of phobias"
