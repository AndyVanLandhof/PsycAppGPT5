      "question": "Rob, a sixth form student, struggles to complete his homework due to hearing threatening voices. Which definition of abnormality best describes his situation?",

        "Cultural relativism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Rob's inability to cope with everyday tasks indicates he is failing to function adequately, which is a key aspect of this definition. This corresponds to: Failure to function adequately."

      "question": "What is a limitation of using statistical infrequency as a definition of abnormality?",
      "options": [
        "It ignores cultural context",
        "It is too subjective",
        "It lacks empirical support",
        "It is too broad"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Statistical infrequency does not consider cultural differences, meaning behaviours considered abnormal in one culture may be normal in another. This corresponds to: It ignores cultural context."

      "options": [
        "Maladaptive behaviour",

        "Failure to function adequately",
        "Deviation from ideal mental health"

      "explanation": "Deviation from ideal mental health outlines specific criteria that, if not met, indicate abnormality"

      "question": "A person who exhibits behaviours that are statistically rare, such as extreme anxiety, is best described by which definition of abnormality?",
      "options": [
        "Deviation from social norms",
        "Statistical infrequency",
        "Failure to function adequately",
        "Cultural relativism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Statistical infrequency defines abnormality as behaviours that are rare within the general population"

    {
      "question": "What is a potential issue with the deviation from ideal mental health definition?",
      "options": [
        "It is too vague",
        "It is culturally biased",
        "It lacks empirical evidence",
        "It is too broad"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Deviation from ideal mental health may be culturally biased, as criteria for mental health can vary significantly across cultures. This corresponds to: It is culturally biased."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of cultural relativism in the context of abnormality?",
      "options": [
        "Abnormality is defined by statistical rarity",
        "Behaviour must be understood within its cultural context",
        "Abnormality is a deviation from social norms",
        "Abnormal behaviour is always maladaptive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cultural relativism emphasizes that behaviour cannot be judged as abnormal without considering the cultural context. This corresponds to: Behaviour must be understood within its cultural context."
