      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Nestadt et al. found that first-degree relatives of individuals with OCD have a five-times greater risk of developing the disorder. This corresponds to: B: They have a five-times greater risk of developing OCD."

    {
      "question": "Which treatment for OCD involves preventing patients from performing their compulsive behaviors while exposing them to their feared stimuli?",
      "options": [
        "A: Systematic desensitisation",

    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the genetic explanation of OCD as suggested by the concordance rates in twin studies?",
      "options": [
        "A: They are always 100%",
        "B: They are never 100%",
        "C: They are only applicable to males",
        "D: They ignore environmental factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The fact that concordance rates for OCD are never 100% suggests that environmental factors also play a role in the disorder. This corresponds to: B: They are never 100%."

        "B: They do not account for shared environments",
        "C: They are too small in sample size",
        "D: They ignore psychological factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Twin studies may not adequately account for shared environmental factors that could influence the development of OCD. This corresponds to: B: They do not account for shared environments."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the two-process model in relation to OCD?",
      "options": [
        "A: It focuses solely on genetic factors",
        "B: It explains OCD as a learned behavior through classical and operant conditioning",
