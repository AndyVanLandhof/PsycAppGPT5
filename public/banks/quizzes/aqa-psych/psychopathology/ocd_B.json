    {
      "question": "In Nestadt et al.'s 2000 study, what was the increased risk of developing OCD for individuals with a first-degree relative who has the disorder?",

        "A: Two times greater",
        "B: Three times greater",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Nestadt et al. found that individuals with a first-degree relative with OCD had a five-times greater risk of developing the disorder. This corresponds to: D: Five times greater."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary focus of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating OCD?",
      "options": [
        "A: Increasing serotonin levels",
        "B: Challenging irrational thoughts",
        "C: Systematic desensitization",
        "D: Flooding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "CBT focuses on challenging and changing irrational thoughts that contribute to OCD. This corresponds to: B: Challenging irrational thoughts."

    {
      "question": "A patient with OCD is treated using exposure and response prevention (ERP). What is the main goal of this treatment?",
      "options": [
        "A: To increase serotonin levels",
        "B: To prevent compulsive behaviors",
        "C: To enhance social skills",
        "D: To improve memory function"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "ERP aims to expose patients to their feared stimuli while preventing them from performing their compulsive behaviors. This corresponds to: B: To prevent compulsive behaviors."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the two-process model in relation to OCD?",
      "options": [
        "A: It focuses solely on genetic factors",
        "B: It emphasizes the role of classical conditioning",
        "C: It ignores environmental influences",
        "D: It is only applicable to phobias"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The two-process model emphasizes that initial learning occurs through classical conditioning, leading to the development of OCD. This corresponds to: B: It emphasizes the role of classical conditioning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the genetic explanation for OCD as highlighted by research findings?",
      "options": [
        "A: It cannot explain the role of environmental factors",
        "B: It is based solely on self-reported data",

        "D: It does not consider treatment effectiveness"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The genetic explanation has limitations as concordance rates are never 100%, indicating that environmental factors also play a role. This corresponds to: A: It cannot explain the role of environmental factors."

      "options": [
        "A: They are the sole cause of OCD",
        "B: They act as a predisposing factor",
        "C: They have no relevance",
        "D: They only affect children"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The diathesis-stress model suggests that genetic factors predispose individuals to OCD, but environmental factors also contribute. This corresponds to: B: They act as a predisposing factor."
