    {
      "question": "Which division of the nervous system is responsible for voluntary muscle movements?",
      "options": [
        "Central nervous system",
        "Peripheral nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Autonomic nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The somatic nervous system transmits information from the CNS to muscles, enabling voluntary movements"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a person encounters a bear, which division of the nervous system is activated to prepare the body for a fight-or-flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Sympathetic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight-or-flight response, increasing heart rate and blood pressure"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the autonomic nervous system?",
      "options": [
        "Control voluntary movements",
        "Regulate involuntary bodily functions",
        "Process sensory information",
        "Transmit messages to the brain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary bodily functions, such as heart rate and digestion. This corresponds to: Regulate involuntary bodily functions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which part of the nervous system is primarily involved in relaying information from the body to the brain?",
      "options": [
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system",
        "Autonomic nervous system",
        "Peripheral nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The peripheral nervous system relays nerve impulses from the body to the CNS and vice versa"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a person is experiencing chronic stress, which system is activated after the initial fight-or-flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Sympathetic nervous system",
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "HPA axis",
        "Somatic nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The HPA axis is activated in response to chronic stress, involving hormonal signals that sustain the stress response"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which division of the nervous system is responsible for involuntary actions such as heart rate and digestion?",
      "options": [
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system",
        "Autonomic nervous system",
        "Peripheral nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The autonomic nervous system controls involuntary bodily functions, including heart rate and digestion"
    },
    {
      "question": "During a stressful event, which neurotransmitter is primarily involved in the fight-or-flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Dopamine",
        "Serotonin",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Cortisol"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is released during the fight-or-flight response, preparing the body for immediate action"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the effects of stress on the body, researchers found that prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to negative health outcomes. What is one potential negative effect?",
      "options": [
        "Increased energy",
        "Lowered immune response",
        "Improved cognitive performance",
        "Enhanced digestion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Prolonged activation of the sympathetic nervous system can impair immune response, leading to health issues. This corresponds to: Lowered immune response."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which system is responsible for returning the body to a state of calm after a stress response?",
      "options": [
        "Sympathetic nervous system",
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The parasympathetic nervous system helps to calm the body down after a stress response, reducing heart rate and blood pressure"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue in studying the effects of the autonomic nervous system on behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Difficulty in measuring involuntary responses",
        "Lack of control over environmental variables",
        "Inability to replicate findings",
        "Over-reliance on self-report measures"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Measuring involuntary responses of the autonomic nervous system can be challenging, making it difficult to obtain accurate data. This corresponds to: Difficulty in measuring involuntary responses."
