      "question": "A researcher uses an EEG to study brain activity during a cognitive task. What is a limitation of this method?",
      "options": [
        "High cost",
        "Poor temporal resolution",
        "Poor spatial resolution",
        "Requires post-mortem analysis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "EEGs have poor spatial resolution, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of brain activity"
