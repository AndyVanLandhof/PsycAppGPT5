  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the first physiological response activated when a stressor is perceived, according to the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Release of oxytocin",
        "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system",
        "Release of cortisol"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system is activated by the hypothalamus when a stressor is perceived, initiating the fight or flight response. This corresponds to: Activation of the sympathetic nervous system."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the fight or flight response, what role does adrenaline play?",
      "options": [
        "It reduces heart rate",
        "It promotes relaxation",
        "It increases heart rate and energy availability",
        "It enhances immune response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is released from the adrenal medulla and causes physiological changes such as increased heart rate and energy availability for the fight or flight response. This corresponds to: It increases heart rate and energy availability."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Taylor et al. (2000), what alternative response do females exhibit under stress?",
      "options": [
        "Fight or flight",
        "Tend and befriend",
        "Freeze response",
        "Aggressive confrontation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Taylor et al. proposed that females exhibit a 'tend and befriend' response to stress, which is influenced by the hormone oxytocin"
    },
    {
      "question": "When a person experiences a stressful event, which part of the brain first activates the stress response?",
      "options": [
        "Cerebellum",
        "Hypothalamus",
        "Amygdala",
        "Pituitary gland"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus is the first part of the brain to activate the stress response by triggering the pituitary gland"
    },
    {
      "question": "A student feels an increased heart rate and 'butterflies' in their stomach before an exam. This is an example of which physiological response?",
      "options": [
        "Parasympathetic response",
        "Fight or flight response",
        "Tend and befriend response",
        "Rest and digest response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The student's increased heart rate and 'butterflies' are indicative of the fight or flight response activated by the sympathetic nervous system"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential limitation of early research on the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "It included both male and female subjects",
        "It focused solely on male animals",
        "It considered the role of oxytocin",
        "It measured long-term stress effects"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Early research often focused solely on male animals, which may overlook important differences in stress responses between genders. This corresponds to: It focused solely on male animals."
    },
    {
      "question": "What physiological changes occur during the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Decreased heart rate and increased saliva production",
        "Increased heart rate and muscle tension",
        "Reduced blood flow to muscles",
        "Increased digestion and energy conservation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "During the fight or flight response, physiological changes include increased heart rate and muscle tension to prepare the body for action"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the parasympathetic nervous system function after a stressor has passed?",
      "options": [
        "It enhances the fight or flight response",
        "It maintains the sympathetic state",
        "It returns the body to a resting state",
        "It increases adrenaline levels"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The parasympathetic nervous system acts as a 'brake' to return the body to its resting state after the stressor has passed. This corresponds to: It returns the body to a resting state."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the SRY gene in the fight or flight response according to Lee and Harley (2012)?",
      "options": [
        "It promotes the tend and befriend response",
        "It directs male development and aggression",
        "It inhibits adrenaline release",
        "It regulates oxytocin levels"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The SRY gene, found on the male Y chromosome, directs male development and promotes aggression, which is linked to the fight or flight response. This corresponds to: It directs male development and aggression."
    },
    {
      "question": "What physiological measure is often used to assess the fight or flight response through skin conductance?",
      "options": [
        "Heart rate variability",
        "Electroencephalogram",
        "Skin conductance response",
        "Blood pressure monitoring"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Skin conductance response is used to measure physiological arousal during stress, as sweating increases with the fight or flight response"
