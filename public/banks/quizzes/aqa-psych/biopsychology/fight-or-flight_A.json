    {
      "question": "What is the first physiological response to a perceived threat according to Gray (1988)?",
      "options": [
        "Fight",
        "Flight",
        "Freeze",
        "Tend"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Gray (1988) suggests that the initial response to a threat is the 'freeze response', where an individual becomes hyper-vigilant"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the fight or flight response, which hormone is primarily released from the adrenal medulla?",
      "options": [
        "Cortisol",
        "Oxytocin",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Noradrenaline"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is released from the adrenal medulla into the bloodstream, triggering physiological changes necessary for the fight or flight response"
    },
    {
      "question": "During a stressful event, which part of the brain activates the pituitary gland?",
      "options": [
        "Cerebellum",
        "Hypothalamus",
        "Amygdala",
        "Cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland, which then triggers the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system"
    },
    {
      "question": "Shelley Taylor et al. (2000) proposed an alternative to the fight or flight response for females. What is this response called?",
      "options": [
        "Tend and Befriend",
        "Fight or Flight",
        "Rest and Digest",
        "Freeze Response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Taylor et al. (2000) suggested that females exhibit a 'tend and befriend' response, which is adaptive for nurturing offspring"
    },
    {
      "question": "A student feels their heart racing and palms sweating before an exam. This is an example of which response?",
      "options": [
        "Rest and Digest",
        "Fight or Flight",
        "Tend and Befriend",
        "Homeostasis"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The physiological changes such as increased heart rate and sweating are characteristic of the fight or flight response triggered by stress"
    },
    {
      "question": "What physiological change occurs when the sympathetic nervous system is activated?",
      "options": [
        "Decreased heart rate",
        "Increased production of saliva",
        "Dilation of pupils",
        "Increased digestion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to physiological changes such as dilation of pupils and increased heart rate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with early research on the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "It included only male participants",
        "It was based on self-reports",
        "It used a small sample size",
        "It focused on chronic stress"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Early research often used male animals, ignoring potential differences in stress responses due to hormonal fluctuations in females. This corresponds to: It included only male participants."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which system acts as a 'brake' to reduce physiological arousal after a stressor has passed?",
      "options": [
        "Sympathetic Nervous System",
        "Parasympathetic Nervous System",
        "Endocrine System",
        "Central Nervous System"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The parasympathetic nervous system reduces the activities increased by the sympathetic nervous system, returning the body to a resting state"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does oxytocin play in the stress response according to Taylor et al. (2000)?",
      "options": [
        "Increases fight or flight response",
        "Inhibits fight or flight response",
        "Has no effect",
        "Increases adrenaline release"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Oxytocin, which is more plentiful in females, inhibits the fight or flight response and promotes 'tend and befriend' behaviors. This corresponds to: Inhibits fight or flight response."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Energy conservation",
        "Immediate energy expenditure",
        "Long-term stress management",
        "Emotional regulation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The fight or flight response is designed for immediate energy expenditure to deal with acute stressors effectively"
