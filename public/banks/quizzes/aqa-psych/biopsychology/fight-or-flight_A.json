    {
      "question": "What is the first physiological response activated when a stressor is perceived, according to the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Release of oxytocin",
        "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system",
        "Increase in cortisol levels"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system is activated by the hypothalamus when a stressor is perceived, leading to the fight or flight response. This corresponds to: Activation of the sympathetic nervous system."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the fight or flight response, which hormone is primarily responsible for physiological changes such as increased heart rate?",
      "options": [
        "Cortisol",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Oxytocin",
        "Noradrenaline"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is released from the adrenal medulla and triggers physiological changes necessary for the fight or flight response"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Taylor et al. (2000), what alternative response do females exhibit in stressful situations?",
      "options": [
        "Fight or flight",
        "Tend and befriend",
        "Freeze response",
        "Aggressive response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Taylor et al. (2000) proposed that females often respond to stress with a 'tend and befriend' response, which is influenced by oxytocin"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a student feels their heart racing and experiences 'butterflies' in their stomach before an exam, which part of the nervous system is primarily responsible for these sensations?",
      "options": [
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Sympathetic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system is activated during stressful situations, leading to physiological arousal such as increased heart rate and gastrointestinal sensations"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the parasympathetic nervous system after a stressor has passed?",
      "options": [
        "To maintain high levels of arousal",
        "To return the body to its resting state",
        "To enhance the fight or flight response",
        "To increase adrenaline production"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The parasympathetic nervous system acts as a 'brake', reducing the activities increased by the sympathetic system and returning the body to a resting state. This corresponds to: To return the body to its resting state."
    },
    {
      "question": "Lee and Harley (2012) found evidence for a genetic basis for gender differences in the fight or flight response. What gene is primarily involved in promoting aggression in males?",
      "options": [
        "SRY gene",
        "Oxytocin gene",
        "Cortisol gene",
        "Adrenaline gene"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The SRY gene, found on the male Y chromosome, directs male development and promotes aggression, influencing the fight or flight response"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a methodological issue related to early research on the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Focus on female subjects",
        "Use of male animals exclusively",
        "Inclusion of both genders",
        "Longitudinal studies"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Early research often used male animals, ignoring potential differences in stress responses due to hormonal fluctuations in females, leading to beta bias. This corresponds to: Use of male animals exclusively."
    },
    {
      "question": "What physiological change occurs when the sympathetic nervous system is activated during the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Decreased heart rate",
        "Increased production of saliva",
        "Dilation of pupils",
        "Increased digestion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to physiological changes such as pupil dilation, which prepares the body for a fight or flight response. This corresponds to: Dilation of pupils."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of oxytocin in the context of stress responses in females?",
      "options": [
        "To increase heart rate",
        "To enhance fight or flight response",
        "To promote 'tend and befriend' behaviors",
        "To suppress adrenaline release"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Oxytocin is associated with 'tend and befriend' behaviors in females, reducing the fight or flight response and promoting nurturing behaviors. This corresponds to: To promote 'tend and befriend' behaviors."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the baseline physiological response to stress before any acute stressor is perceived?",
      "options": [
        "Parasympathetic state",
        "Sympathetic state",
        "Rest and digest state",
        "Fight or flight state"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The baseline physiological response is the parasympathetic state, which is the body's resting state before any stressor is perceived"
