    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of Broca's area in the brain?",

        "Language comprehension",
        "Speech production",
        "Visual processing",
        "Motor coordination"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Broca's area is primarily responsible for speech production, and damage to this area can lead to Broca's aphasia"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of brain plasticity, what does the term 'functional recovery' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to create new neurons",
        "The redistribution of functions to undamaged areas after trauma",
        "The process of learning new skills",
        "The brain's adaptation during childhood only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Functional recovery refers to the brain's ability to transfer functions from damaged areas to undamaged areas after trauma. This corresponds to: The redistribution of functions to undamaged areas after trauma."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which study provided evidence for the brain's ability to adapt and change due to experience?",
      "options": [
        "Hubel & Wiesel (1963)",
        "Corkin et al. (1989)",
        "Schneider et al. (2014)",
        "Danelli et al. (2013)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Hubel & Wiesel (1963) demonstrated that the brain can adapt and change in response to visual experiences"
    },
    {
      "question": "Lotta's grandmother has suffered a stroke affecting her speech. Which type of recovery might she experience due to brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "Increased fluency in speech",
        "Loss of motor function",
        "Redistribution of language functions",
        "Permanent speech impairment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Due to brain plasticity, Lotta's grandmother might experience a redistribution of language functions to undamaged areas of the brain"
    },
    {
      "question": "What factor has been shown to influence the rate of recovery after brain trauma, according to Schneider et al. (2014)?",
      "options": [
        "Age",
        "Gender",
        "Cognitive reserve",
        "Physical health"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Schneider et al. (2014) found that cognitive reserve, such as education level, significantly influences recovery rates after brain trauma"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue often associated with studies on brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of longitudinal data",
        "Over-reliance on animal studies",
        "Small sample sizes",
        "Inconsistent definitions of plasticity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Many studies on brain plasticity, such as those by Hubel & Wiesel, often rely on animal studies, which may not fully generalize to human brain function. This corresponds to: Over-reliance on animal studies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is an experiential factor that may enhance brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "Age",
        "Meditation",
        "Gender",
        "Physical exhaustion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Experiential factors like meditation have been shown to enhance brain plasticity and functional recovery"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one limitation of using case studies to investigate functional recovery in the brain?",
      "options": [
        "They provide quantitative data",
        "They are often not generalizable",
        "They require large sample sizes",
        "They lack detail"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Case studies often focus on individual cases, which can limit the generalizability of findings to the wider population. This corresponds to: They are often not generalizable."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Elbert et al. (2001), how does age affect functional recovery after brain damage?",
      "options": [
        "Younger individuals recover faster",
        "Older individuals recover faster",
        "Age has no effect",
        "Recovery is the same for all ages"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Elbert et al. (2001) found that younger individuals tend to recover from brain damage more effectively than older individuals. This corresponds to: Younger individuals recover faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one potential outcome of damage to the motor cortex?",
      "options": [
        "Increased speech fluency",
        "Paralysis on the opposite side of the body",
        "Enhanced cognitive abilities",
        "Improved sensory perception"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Damage to the motor cortex can lead to paralysis or motor impairments on the opposite side of the body due to its control over movement. This corresponds to: Paralysis on the opposite side of the body."
