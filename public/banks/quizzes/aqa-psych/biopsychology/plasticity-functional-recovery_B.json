    {
      "question": "What is brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to remain unchanged",
        "The brain's ability to change and adapt due to experience",
        "The brain's inability to recover from trauma",
        "The brain's fixed structure throughout life"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Brain plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience and new learning. This corresponds to: The brain's ability to change and adapt due to experience."

    {
      "question": "Which area of the brain is primarily associated with language production?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's area",
        "Broca's area",
        "Motor cortex",
        "Somatosensory cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Broca's area is primarily responsible for language production, and damage to this area can lead to Broca's aphasia"
    },

      "question": "In a study by Schneider et al. (2014), what factor was found to influence recovery after brain trauma?",
      "options": [
        "Age",
        "Gender",
        "Cognitive reserve",
        "Physical fitness"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Schneider et al. (2014) found that cognitive reserve, which relates to educational level, significantly influences recovery after brain trauma"

      "question": "Lotta's grandmother has suffered a stroke affecting her speech. What type of aphasia is she likely experiencing?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's aphasia",
        "Global aphasia",
        "Broca's aphasia",
        "Anomic aphasia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Due to damage to Broca's area, Lotta's grandmother is likely experiencing Broca's aphasia, characterized by difficulty in speech production"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is functional recovery in the context of brain trauma?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to remain unchanged",
        "The redistribution of functions to undamaged areas",
        "The permanent loss of brain functions",
        "The inability to adapt to new experiences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Functional recovery refers to the brain's ability to redistribute or transfer functions usually performed by damaged areas to other undamaged areas. This corresponds to: The redistribution of functions to undamaged areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "After a stroke, physiotherapy may enhance recovery due to which brain characteristic?",
      "options": [
        "Neurogenesis",
        "Plasticity",
        "Localization",
        "Hemispheric lateralization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Physiotherapy may enhance recovery by promoting brain plasticity, allowing the brain to adapt and form new neural pathways"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue can affect the generalizability of findings on brain plasticity from animal studies?",
      "options": [
        "Small sample sizes",
        "Differences in species",
        "Lack of control groups",
        "Short duration of studies"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Findings from animal studies may not generalize to humans due to significant differences in brain structure and function across species. This corresponds to: Differences in species."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Hubel and Wiesel (1963) demonstrate regarding brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's functions are fixed",
        "Sensory deprivation can lead to changes in the visual cortex",
        "All brain functions are localized",
        "Plasticity only occurs in children"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hubel and Wiesel (1963) demonstrated that sensory deprivation can lead to changes in the visual cortex, highlighting brain plasticity"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which factor is associated with reduced functional recovery in older adults after brain trauma?",
      "options": [
        "Higher cognitive reserve",
        "Increased age",
        "Greater physical fitness",
        "Better social support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Research indicates that functional recovery tends to decrease with age, making older adults less likely to fully recover from brain trauma. This corresponds to: Increased age."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential benefit of engaging in activities like learning new skills after brain trauma?",
      "options": [
        "It has no effect on recovery",
        "It can enhance brain plasticity",
        "It may worsen recovery",
        "It only benefits younger individuals"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Engaging in activities such as learning new skills can enhance brain plasticity, promoting recovery after brain trauma. This corresponds to: It can enhance brain plasticity."
