    {
      "question": "What technique uses magnetic fields and radio waves to monitor blood flow in the brain, providing insights into brain activity?",
      "options": [
        "Electroencephalogram (EEG)",
        "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)",

      "question": "In Burnett et al. (2009), which brain region was found to be active when individuals felt guilty?",
      "options": [
        "Broca's area",
        "Medial prefrontal cortex",
        "Hippocampus",
        "Amygdala"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The medial prefrontal cortex is associated with social emotions, including guilt"

    {
      "question": "A researcher uses EEG to study brain activity during a memory task. What is a limitation of using EEG in this context?",
      "options": [
        "High spatial resolution",
        "Low temporal resolution",
        "High cost",
        "Requires invasive procedures"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "EEGs have poor spatial resolution, making it difficult to pinpoint exact brain activity locations. This corresponds to: Low temporal resolution."

      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Post-mortem examinations analyze brain structure to identify causes of behavioral deficits"
    },
    {
      "question": "An experiment using fMRI shows increased activity in the visual cortex when participants view images. What is a methodological concern regarding this technique?",
      "options": [
        "It is too inexpensive",
        "It has high temporal resolution",
        "Interpretation can be complex",
        "It is non-invasive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The interpretation of fMRI results can be complex and influenced by various factors. This corresponds to: Interpretation can be complex."

    {
      "question": "A study finds that participants show different brain activity patterns when lying compared to telling the truth. Which method is likely used to identify these patterns?",
      "options": [
        "Post-Mortem Examinations",
        "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)",
        "Electroencephalogram (EEG)",
        "Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "fMRI is effective for identifying active brain areas during specific cognitive tasks, such as lying. This corresponds to: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)."
