    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the endocrine system?",
      "options": [
        "To transmit nerve impulses",
        "To regulate physiological processes through hormones",
        "To control voluntary movements",
        "To process sensory information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system regulates physiological processes through the release of hormones into the bloodstream. This corresponds to: To regulate physiological processes through hormones."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which gland is known as the 'master gland' of the endocrine system?",
      "options": [
        "Adrenal gland",
        "Thyroid gland",
        "Pituitary gland",
        "Pancreas"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The pituitary gland is referred to as the 'master gland' because it controls the release of hormones from other endocrine glands"
    },
    {
      "question": "During a stressful event, which hormone is primarily released from the adrenal medulla?",
      "options": [
        "Cortisol",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is released from the adrenal medulla in response to stress, preparing the body for the fight or flight response"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a student feels anxious before an exam, which part of the nervous system is activated first?",
      "options": [
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Sympathetic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system is activated first, leading to physiological arousal in response to the perceived threat of the exam"
    },
    {
      "question": "What physiological changes occur due to the release of adrenaline?",
      "options": [
        "Decreased heart rate",
        "Increased metabolic rate",
        "Reduced blood flow to muscles",
        "Increased digestive activity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline triggers physiological changes such as increased heart rate and metabolic rate, preparing the body for action. This corresponds to: Increased metabolic rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the endocrine system maintain stable hormone levels in the bloodstream?",
      "options": [
        "Through feedback mechanisms",
        "By increasing hormone production continuously",
        "By using nerve impulses",
        "Through random secretion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system uses feedback mechanisms to regulate hormone levels, similar to a thermostat controlling temperature. This corresponds to: Through feedback mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a person is exposed to bright light in the morning, which type of external factor helps regulate their circadian rhythm?",
      "options": [
        "Endogenous pacemaker",
        "Exogenous zeitgeber",
        "Hormonal feedback",
        "Sympathetic response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bright light acts as an exogenous zeitgeber, helping to reset the body's internal clock and regulate circadian rhythms"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system during stress?",
      "options": [
        "They operate independently",
        "They work in opposition to each other",
        "They work in parallel to produce physiological arousal",
        "They have no effect on each other"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system work in parallel during stress to produce physiological arousal necessary for the fight or flight response. This corresponds to: They work in parallel to produce physiological arousal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential limitation of relying solely on the endocrine system for physiological responses?",
      "options": [
        "It acts too quickly",
        "It has limited effects on the body",
        "It operates slower than the nervous system",
        "It only affects one organ at a time"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system acts more slowly than the nervous system, which can be a limitation in situations requiring immediate responses. This corresponds to: It operates slower than the nervous system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which hormone is produced by the adrenal cortex in response to stress?",
      "options": [
        "Adrenaline",
        "Cortisol",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cortisol is produced by the adrenal cortex in response to stress, helping to regulate various bodily functions"
