    {
      "question": "Which gland is known as the 'master gland' of the endocrine system, controlling the release of hormones from other glands?",
      "options": [
        "Adrenal gland",
        "Thyroid gland",
        "Pituitary gland",
        "Pancreas"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The pituitary gland is referred to as the 'master gland' because it regulates the activity of other endocrine glands"
    },
    {
      "question": "During a stressful event, which part of the brain activates the pituitary gland to trigger the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Cerebellum",
        "Hypothalamus",
        "Amygdala",
        "Cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland, initiating the fight or flight response"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a student feels anxious before exams, which hormone is primarily released to prepare the body for a fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Cortisol",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is released from the adrenal medulla during stress, leading to physiological changes necessary for the fight or flight response"
    },
    {
      "question": "What physiological changes occur in the body due to the release of adrenaline during the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Decreased heart rate",
        "Increased metabolic rate",
        "Reduced blood flow to muscles",
        "Increased digestive activity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline increases heart rate and metabolic rate, preparing the body for immediate physical action. This corresponds to: Increased metabolic rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the endocrine system regulate hormone levels in the bloodstream?",
      "options": [
        "Through synaptic transmission",
        "Via feedback mechanisms",
        "By direct nerve stimulation",
        "Using neurotransmitters"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system uses feedback mechanisms to regulate hormone levels, similar to a thermostat. This corresponds to: Via feedback mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a person is experiencing chronic stress, which hormone is likely to be consistently elevated in their bloodstream?",
      "options": [
        "Adrenaline",
        "Cortisol",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cortisol is often elevated during chronic stress, affecting various physiological processes"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system during stress?",
      "options": [
        "They operate independently of each other.",
        "They work in parallel to regulate physiological responses.",
        "The autonomic nervous system inhibits the endocrine system.",
        "The endocrine system is faster than the autonomic nervous system."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system work together to manage physiological responses during stress. This corresponds to: They work in parallel to regulate physiological responses.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the adrenal cortex in the endocrine system?",
      "options": [
        "To release adrenaline",
        "To produce cortisol",
        "To regulate metabolism",
        "To control reproductive hormones"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The adrenal cortex produces cortisol, which is involved in the body's stress response. This corresponds to: To produce cortisol."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the endocrine system, what is a potential limitation of relying solely on hormonal responses to stress?",
      "options": [
        "Hormones act too quickly.",
        "Hormonal responses are not widespread.",
        "Hormonal effects can be long-lasting and may not be easily reversible.",
        "Hormones only affect one organ."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hormonal effects can be prolonged, which may lead to issues if the stressor persists, as the body remains in a heightened state. This corresponds to: Hormonal effects can be long-lasting and may not be easily reversible.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which hormone is primarily responsible for increasing heart rate and preparing the body for action during the fight or flight response?",
      "options": [
        "Cortisol",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is the key hormone that increases heart rate and prepares the body for immediate action"
