    {
      "question": "What is brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to remain unchanged",
        "The brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience",
        "The brain's inability to recover from trauma",
        "The brain's fixed structure throughout life"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Brain plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience and new learning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which area of the brain is primarily associated with speech production?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's area",
        "Broca's area",
        "Hippocampus",
        "Cerebellum"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Broca's area is primarily responsible for language and speech production"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a case study, a patient with damage to Broca's area was found to have difficulty in producing fluent speech. What condition is this patient likely experiencing?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's aphasia",
        "Broca's aphasia",
        "Dyslexia",
        "Anomia"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Damage to Broca's area typically results in Broca's aphasia, characterized by non-fluent speech"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does functional recovery of the brain refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to grow new neurons",
        "The brain's ability to redistribute functions from damaged areas to undamaged areas",
        "The brain's inability to adapt after trauma",
        "The brain's fixed functions post-injury"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Functional recovery refers to the brain's ability to redistribute functions usually performed by damaged areas to other undamaged areas. This corresponds to: The brain's ability to redistribute functions from damaged areas to undamaged areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "A study found that women recover from brain trauma faster than men. What does this suggest about functional recovery?",
      "options": [
        "Recovery is not influenced by gender",
        "Gender may play a role in recovery rates",
        "All individuals recover at the same rate",
        "Men have better plasticity than women"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The finding suggests that gender may influence recovery rates, indicating a potential variable in functional recovery. This corresponds to: Gender may play a role in recovery rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue often associated with studies on brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "They are always conducted on large samples",
        "They often rely on self-reported data",
        "They may lack control groups",
        "They are conducted exclusively on animals"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Many studies on brain plasticity may lack control groups, which can affect the validity of the findings. This corresponds to: They may lack control groups."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Schneider et al. (2014), what factor significantly affects recovery after brain trauma?",
      "options": [
        "Age",
        "Gender",
        "Socioeconomic status",
        "Diet"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Schneider et al. (2014) found that age is a significant factor affecting recovery after brain trauma"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does physiotherapy play in the recovery of brain functions after trauma?",
      "options": [
        "It has no impact on recovery",
        "It enhances brain stimulation and recovery",
        "It only helps with physical injuries",
        "It is less effective than medication"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Physiotherapy can enhance brain stimulation and may improve recovery outcomes following brain trauma. This corresponds to: It enhances brain stimulation and recovery."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of using animal studies to understand human brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "Animals cannot exhibit plasticity",
        "Human brains are structurally different from animal brains",
        "Animal studies are always ethically questionable",
        "Animal studies provide conclusive evidence for human recovery"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Human brains are structurally different from animal brains, which limits the generalizability of findings from animal studies"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of cognitive reserve in functional recovery?",
      "options": [
        "It has no impact on recovery",
        "Higher cognitive reserve is linked to better recovery outcomes",
        "Cognitive reserve only affects younger individuals",
        "It is irrelevant to brain plasticity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Higher cognitive reserve is associated with better recovery outcomes, indicating that cognitive factors play a role in functional recovery. This corresponds to: Higher cognitive reserve is linked to better recovery outcomes."
