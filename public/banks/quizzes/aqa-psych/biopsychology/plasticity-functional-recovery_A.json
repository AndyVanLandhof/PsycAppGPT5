    {
      "question": "What is brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to remain unchanged",
        "The brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Brain plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience and new learning"

      "question": "Which area of the brain is primarily associated with language production?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's area",
        "Broca's area",
        "Motor cortex",
        "Somatosensory cortex"

      "question": "In a study by Schneider et al. (2014), what factor was found to influence recovery after brain trauma?",
      "options": [
        "Age",
        "Gender",
        "Cognitive reserve",
        "Physical fitness"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Schneider et al. (2014) found that cognitive reserve significantly influenced recovery after brain trauma"

      "question": "After a stroke, Lotta's grandmother may experience difficulty in speech due to damage in which area?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's area",
        "Broca's area",
        "Visual cortex",
        "Auditory cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Damage to Broca's area can lead to language and speech problems, known as Broca's aphasia"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is functional recovery in the context of brain trauma?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to remain unchanged",
        "The redistribution of functions from damaged areas to undamaged areas",
        "The permanent loss of brain functions",
        "The brain's inability to adapt after trauma"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Functional recovery refers to the brain's ability to redistribute functions usually performed by damaged areas to other undamaged areas. This corresponds to: The redistribution of functions from damaged areas to undamaged areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "Lotta believes her grandmother will not recover due to her age. Which aspect of brain recovery might challenge this belief?",
      "options": [
        "Plasticity allows for recovery regardless of age",
        "Older brains cannot adapt",
        "Recovery is only possible in children",
        "Plasticity decreases with age"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Brain plasticity allows for recovery and adaptation, which can occur even in older individuals. This corresponds to: Plasticity allows for recovery regardless of age."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue can arise when studying brain plasticity through case studies?",
      "options": [
        "They provide quantitative data",
        "They often lack generalizability",
        "They are always ethically sound",
        "They are easy to replicate"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Case studies often lack generalizability due to their focus on individual cases, making it difficult to apply findings broadly. This corresponds to: They often lack generalizability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following factors has been shown to enhance plasticity and functional recovery?",
      "options": [
        "Age",
        "Meditation",
        "Genetics",
        "Diet"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Experiential factors such as meditation have been shown to enhance brain plasticity and functional recovery"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Hubel and Wiesel (1963) demonstrate about brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "It is fixed after childhood",
        "It can be influenced by visual experience",
        "It is only present in mammals",
        "It leads to permanent loss of function"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hubel and Wiesel (1963) demonstrated that brain plasticity can be influenced by visual experience, particularly in the visual cortex. This corresponds to: It can be influenced by visual experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of using animal studies to investigate brain plasticity?",
      "options": [
        "They provide too much data",
        "They are ethically problematic",
        "They cannot be replicated",
        "They lack ecological validity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Animal studies may lack ecological validity, as the findings may not be directly applicable to human brain function. This corresponds to: They lack ecological validity."
