  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of excitatory neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine?",
      "options": [
        "They decrease the likelihood of neuron firing",
        "They increase the likelihood of neuron firing",
        "They inhibit synaptic transmission",
        "They block receptor sites"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Excitatory neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, act as 'on switches' that increase the likelihood of an excitatory signal being sent to the postsynaptic cell. This corresponds to: They increase the likelihood of neuron firing."
    },
    {
      "question": "In synaptic transmission, what occurs when an inhibitory neurotransmitter binds to a postsynaptic receptor?",
      "options": [
        "The postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire",
        "An excitatory post-synaptic potential is generated",
        "The postsynaptic neuron is less likely to fire",
        "The synaptic cleft is widened"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Binding of an inhibitory neurotransmitter results in an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), making it less likely for the postsynaptic neuron to fire. This corresponds to: The postsynaptic neuron is less likely to fire."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the process called that determines whether a neuron will fire based on the sum of excitatory and inhibitory inputs?",
      "options": [
        "Transmission",
        "Summation",
        "Inhibition",
        "Excitation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The net result of excitatory and inhibitory inputs is known as summation, which determines whether the neuron will fire"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher observes that a participant's heart rate increases after being startled. This response is primarily mediated by which neurotransmitter?",
      "options": [
        "Serotonin",
        "GABA",
        "Noradrenaline",
        "Acetylcholine"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Noradrenaline is involved in the autonomic nervous system and is responsible for increasing heart rate during stress responses"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, participants are shown a word in their right visual field and asked to name it. This demonstrates which aspect of hemispheric lateralization?",
      "options": [
        "Right hemisphere dominance for language",
        "Left hemisphere dominance for language",
        "Bilateral processing",
        "Visual-spatial processing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The left hemisphere is typically dominant for language processing, allowing participants to verbally name words presented in the right visual field. This corresponds to: Left hemisphere dominance for language."
    },
    {
      "question": "Research on split-brain patients has shown that they can draw an object presented to their left visual field but cannot name it. This suggests what about the right hemisphere?",
      "options": [
        "It is responsible for language production",
        "It is involved in visual processing",
        "It controls motor functions",
        "It has no role in visual perception"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This finding indicates that while the right hemisphere can process visual information, it lacks the language capabilities typically associated with the left hemisphere. This corresponds to: It is involved in visual processing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which neurotransmitter is primarily responsible for calming the nervous system and inducing sleep?",
      "options": [
        "Acetylcholine",
        "Noradrenaline",
        "Serotonin",
        "GABA"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that regulates excitement in the nervous system, thus calming it and promoting sleep"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a person experiences anxiety and their GABA levels are low, what effect would this have on their nervous system?",
      "options": [
        "Increased excitability",
        "Decreased heart rate",
        "Enhanced relaxation",
        "Reduced synaptic transmission"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Low GABA levels would lead to increased excitability in the nervous system, contributing to heightened anxiety"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue arises from using split-brain patients to study hemispheric lateralization?",
      "options": [
        "Small sample sizes limit generalizability",
        "Participants may have confounding variables",
        "The procedure is ethically questionable",
        "Results are often inconsistent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The small sample sizes in split-brain research limit the ability to generalize findings to the wider population. This corresponds to: Small sample sizes limit generalizability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the synaptic cleft in synaptic transmission?",
      "options": [
        "It allows neurotransmitters to be released",
        "It connects sensory and motor neurons",
        "It prevents neurotransmitter binding",
        "It facilitates the electrical impulse"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The synaptic cleft is the gap between neurons where neurotransmitters are released and travel to bind with receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. This corresponds to: It allows neurotransmitters to be released."
