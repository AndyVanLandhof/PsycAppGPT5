    {
      "question": "Which area of the brain is primarily associated with speech production, as identified by Paul Broca in 1861?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's area",
        "Motor cortex",
        "Broca's area",
        "Somatosensory cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Broca's area is located in the left hemisphere and is crucial for speech production"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of localisation of function, which part of the brain is responsible for processing visual information?",
      "options": [
        "Auditory cortex",
        "Visual cortex",
        "Broca's area",
        "Wernicke's area"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The visual cortex is specifically responsible for processing visual stimuli"
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with damage to Wernicke's area may struggle with which of the following?",
      "options": [
        "Understanding spoken language",
        "Producing speech",
        "Motor control",
        "Visual processing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Wernicke's area is associated with language comprehension, so damage here affects understanding. This corresponds to: Understanding spoken language."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study on split-brain patients, Roger Sperry found that participants could name objects presented in which visual field?",
      "options": [
        "Left visual field",
        "Right visual field",
        "Both visual fields",
        "Neither visual field"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Objects presented in the right visual field are processed by the left hemisphere, which controls speech"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher presents an image to the left visual field of a split-brain patient. What is the expected outcome regarding the patient's ability to verbalize what they saw?",
      "options": [
        "They can verbalize it",
        "They cannot verbalize it",
        "They can draw it",
        "They can write it down"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Since the left visual field is processed by the right hemisphere, which lacks verbal capabilities, they cannot verbalize it"
    },
    {
      "question": "A study shows that damage to the motor cortex results in impaired movement of which body part?",
      "options": [
        "Hands",
        "Eyes",
        "Ears",
        "Stomach"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The motor cortex is responsible for voluntary movement, particularly in the hands and limbs"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often raised regarding the research on localisation of function in the brain?",
      "options": [
        "Use of animal studies",
        "Small sample sizes",
        "Lack of control groups",
        "Ethical concerns"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Research involving brain surgery or damage raises ethical concerns regarding the treatment of participants"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements best reflects the concept of hemispheric lateralisation?",
      "options": [
        "Both hemispheres perform identical functions",
        "The left hemisphere is responsible for language",
        "The right hemisphere controls the left side of the body",
        "All functions are shared equally between hemispheres"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hemispheric lateralisation indicates that the left hemisphere is primarily responsible for language processing. This corresponds to: The left hemisphere is responsible for language."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of brain plasticity, what does functional recovery refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to grow new neurons",
        "The brain's ability to adapt after injury",
        "The brain's ability to maintain homeostasis",
        "The brain's ability to process information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Functional recovery refers to the brain's ability to reorganize and transfer functions from damaged areas to undamaged areas. This corresponds to: The brain's ability to adapt after injury."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a common criticism of the simplistic view of left-brained and right-brained functions?",
      "options": [
        "It ignores the role of the spinal cord",
        "It oversimplifies complex brain functions",
        "It suggests one hemisphere is dominant",
        "It does not consider neuroplasticity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This view oversimplifies the complex interactions and functions of both hemispheres in brain activity. This corresponds to: It oversimplifies complex brain functions."
