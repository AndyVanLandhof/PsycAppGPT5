  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which area of the brain is primarily associated with language production, as identified by Paul Broca in 1861?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's area",
        "Motor cortex",
        "Broca's area",
        "Somatosensory cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Broca's area is located in the left hemisphere and is crucial for speech production"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Roger Sperry's split-brain research, participants were unable to verbally identify objects presented in which visual field?",
      "options": [
        "Right visual field",
        "Left visual field",
        "Both visual fields",
        "Neither visual field"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Objects presented in the left visual field are processed by the right hemisphere, which lacks verbal capabilities"
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with damage to Wernicke's area would likely experience difficulties in which of the following?",
      "options": [
        "Understanding spoken language",
        "Producing coherent speech",
        "Motor control",
        "Visual processing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Wernicke's area is responsible for language comprehension, so damage here affects understanding. This corresponds to: Understanding spoken language."
    },
    {
      "question": "A study found that a patient with a left hemisphere stroke had difficulty with language tasks but could still sing. This supports which aspect of brain function?",
      "options": [
        "Localisation of function",
        "Hemispheric lateralisation",
        "Neuroplasticity",
        "Cortical specialisation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This case illustrates localisation of function, where specific brain areas are responsible for specific tasks"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of hemispheric lateralisation?",
      "options": [
        "Both hemispheres perform identical functions",
        "Each hemisphere has specialised functions",
        "The brain functions as a single unit",
        "Only the left hemisphere is involved in cognitive tasks"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hemispheric lateralisation refers to the idea that the two hemispheres of the brain have different roles. This corresponds to: Each hemisphere has specialised functions."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a patient with split-brain surgery is shown an image in their left visual field, what is the expected outcome?",
      "options": [
        "They can describe the image",
        "They can draw the image with their left hand",
        "They can name the image",
        "They cannot respond at all"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The right hemisphere processes the image but cannot communicate verbally, so they can draw it with their left hand. This corresponds to: They can draw the image with their left hand."
    },
    {
      "question": "One criticism of the localisation of function theory is that it may oversimplify brain function. This is an example of which evaluative point?",
      "options": [
        "Reductionism",
        "Holism",
        "Determinism",
        "Functionalism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Oversimplifying brain function to specific areas ignores the complex interactions between different brain regions. This corresponds to: Reductionism."
    },
    {
      "question": "Research has shown that the brain can adapt and reorganise itself after injury. This phenomenon is known as what?",
      "options": [
        "Neurogenesis",
        "Plasticity",
        "Localisation",
        "Lateralisation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Plasticity refers to the brain's ability to change and adapt as a result of experience or injury"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the somatosensory cortex?",
      "options": [
        "Language processing",
        "Visual processing",
        "Touch sensation",
        "Motor control"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The somatosensory cortex is responsible for processing sensory information from the body, particularly touch. This corresponds to: Touch sensation."
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with damage to the motor cortex may experience difficulties in which of the following?",
      "options": [
        "Understanding language",
        "Producing speech",
        "Physical movement",
        "Visual recognition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The motor cortex is responsible for planning and executing voluntary movements, so damage here affects physical movement"
    }
