    {
      "question": "What is the primary role of neurotransmitters in synaptic transmission?",
      "options": [
        "To generate action potentials",
        "To carry signals across the synaptic gap",
        "To inhibit nerve impulses",
        "To regulate blood pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that carry signals across the synaptic gap to the receptor site on the postsynaptic cell. This corresponds to: To carry signals across the synaptic gap."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which neurotransmitter is classified as an inhibitory neurotransmitter?",
      "options": [
        "Acetylcholine",
        "Noradrenaline",
        "Serotonin",
        "Dopamine"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Serotonin is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that decreases the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing"
    },
    {
      "question": "In synaptic transmission, what occurs when an excitatory neurotransmitter binds to a postsynaptic receptor?",
      "options": [
        "Inhibitory postsynaptic potential",
        "Excitatory postsynaptic potential",
        "Action potential generation",
        "Neurotransmitter reuptake"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Binding of an excitatory neurotransmitter causes an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), making the postsynaptic cell more likely to fire"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that a large number of EPSPs are generated at many different synapses on the same postsynaptic neuron simultaneously. What is this process called?",
      "options": [
        "Temporal summation",
        "Spatial summation",
        "Neurotransmitter release",
        "Inhibition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This process is known as spatial summation, where multiple excitatory inputs increase the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a person experiences increased heart rate and sweating due to a perceived threat, which neurotransmitter is likely involved in this response?",
      "options": [
        "GABA",
        "Serotonin",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Acetylcholine"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is involved in the fight-or-flight response, leading to physiological changes such as increased heart rate and sweating"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a neurotransmitter is reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron after triggering an electric pulse, what is this process called?",
      "options": [
        "Reuptake",
        "Synaptic transmission",
        "Excitation",
        "Inhibition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Reuptake is the process where neurotransmitters are reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron after they have triggered an electric pulse"
    },
    {
      "question": "A study on synaptic transmission indicates that inhibitory neurotransmitters decrease the likelihood of neuron firing. What is a potential methodological issue with this research?",
      "options": [
        "Small sample size",
        "Lack of control variables",
        "Unidirectional impulses",
        "Overreliance on animal studies"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Research findings may not be generalizable due to small sample sizes, limiting the ability to create nomothetic theories"
    },
    {
      "question": "In synaptic transmission, what is the effect of GABA on the postsynaptic neuron?",
      "options": [
        "Increases likelihood of firing",
        "Decreases likelihood of firing",
        "Has no effect",
        "Increases action potential frequency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, decreasing the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing. This corresponds to: Decreases likelihood of firing."
    },
    {
      "question": "When a person experiences a calming effect after neurotransmitter release, which neurotransmitter is likely responsible?",
      "options": [
        "Noradrenaline",
        "GABA",
        "Dopamine",
        "Serotonin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "GABA is known to regulate excitement in the nervous system, acting as a natural form of anxiety reducer"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term for the process by which a nerve impulse passes across the synaptic cleft from one neuron to another?",
      "options": [
        "Synaptic transmission",
        "Neurotransmitter release",
        "Action potential",
        "Neural inhibition"
