    {
      "question": "What is the primary role of neurotransmitters in synaptic transmission?",
      "options": [
        "To generate action potentials",
        "To carry signals across the synaptic gap",
        "To inhibit nerve impulses",
        "To increase blood pressure"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that carry signals across the synaptic gap to the receptor site on the postsynaptic cell. This corresponds to: To carry signals across the synaptic gap."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which neurotransmitter is classified as an inhibitory neurotransmitter?",
      "options": [
        "Acetylcholine",
        "Noradrenaline",
        "Serotonin",
        "Dopamine"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Serotonin is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that decreases the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing"
    },
    {
      "question": "In synaptic transmission, what occurs when an excitatory neurotransmitter binds to a postsynaptic receptor?",
      "options": [
        "Inhibitory postsynaptic potential",
        "Excitatory postsynaptic potential",
        "Neurotransmitter reuptake",
        "Vesicle fusion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Binding of an excitatory neurotransmitter results in an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), making the postsynaptic cell more likely to fire"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a neuron receives both excitatory and inhibitory signals, what determines whether it will fire?",
      "options": [
        "The type of neurotransmitter",
        "The strength of the action potential",
        "The summation of EPSPs and IPSPs",
        "The rate of neurotransmitter release"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The likelihood of the neuron firing is determined by the summation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. This corresponds to: The summation of EPSPs and IPSPs."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher observes that a participant's heart rate increases after exposure to a stressful stimulus. This response is primarily mediated by which neurotransmitter?",
      "options": [
        "GABA",
        "Serotonin",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Acetylcholine"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is involved in the fight-or-flight response, which increases heart rate in response to stress"
    },
    {
      "question": "During an experiment, a participant is shown a word in their right visual field and can verbally report it. This suggests which hemisphere is primarily responsible for language processing?",
      "options": [
        "Left hemisphere",
        "Right hemisphere",
        "Both hemispheres equally",
        "Neither hemisphere"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The left hemisphere is typically responsible for language processing, as evidenced by split-brain research"
    },
    {
      "question": "Research on split-brain patients has shown that they may struggle to verbally identify objects presented to their left visual field. What does this suggest about hemispheric lateralization?",
      "options": [
        "Both hemispheres process language equally",
        "The right hemisphere is responsible for verbal processing",
        "The left hemisphere is dominant for language",
        "Visual processing occurs only in the right hemisphere"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This finding indicates that the left hemisphere is dominant for language, limiting verbal identification from the right visual field"
    },
    {
      "question": "One limitation of using split-brain patients to study hemispheric lateralization is the small sample size. What does this imply for the generalizability of the findings?",
      "options": [
        "Findings can be generalized to the general population",
        "Findings may not represent the wider population",
        "Findings are universally applicable",
        "Findings are only relevant to split-brain patients"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The small sample size limits the ability to generalize findings to the broader population, as individual differences may not be accounted for. This corresponds to: Findings may not represent the wider population."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the process called when a neurotransmitter is reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron after triggering an electrical pulse?",
      "options": [
        "Reuptake",
        "Inhibition",
        "Excitation",
        "Degradation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Reuptake is the process by which neurotransmitters are reabsorbed by the presynaptic neuron after synaptic transmission"

    {
      "question": "In synaptic transmission, what effect does GABA have on the postsynaptic neuron?",
      "options": [
        "Increases excitability",
        "Decreases excitability",
        "Has no effect",
        "Increases action potential frequency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "GABA acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, decreasing the likelihood of the postsynaptic neuron firing. This corresponds to: Decreases excitability."
