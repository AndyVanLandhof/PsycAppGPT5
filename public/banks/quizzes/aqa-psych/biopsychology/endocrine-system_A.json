    {
      "question": "Which gland is often referred to as the 'master gland' of the endocrine system due to its role in regulating other glands?",
      "options": [
        "Adrenal gland",
        "Thyroid gland",
        "Pituitary gland",
        "Pancreas"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The pituitary gland is known as the 'master gland' because it controls the release of hormones from all other endocrine glands"
    },
    {
      "question": "During a stressful event, which hormone is primarily released by the adrenal medulla to prepare the body for fight or flight?",
      "options": [
        "Cortisol",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is released from the adrenal medulla during stress, triggering physiological changes necessary for the fight or flight response"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a student feels their heart racing before an exam, which part of the nervous system is primarily activated?",
      "options": [
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Sympathetic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system is activated in response to stress, leading to physiological arousal such as increased heart rate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the endocrine system?",
      "options": [
        "To transmit electrical signals",
        "To produce and secrete hormones",
        "To control voluntary movements",
        "To process sensory information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system's main function is to produce and secrete hormones that regulate various physiological processes in the body"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which hormone is produced by the adrenal cortex in response to stress?",
      "options": [
        "Adrenaline",
        "Cortisol",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cortisol is produced by the adrenal cortex and is involved in the body's response to stress"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a person is experiencing a 'sick' feeling in their stomach due to stress, which physiological response is likely occurring?",
      "options": [
        "Rest and digest response",
        "Fight or flight response",
        "Homeostasis",
        "Metabolic rate decrease"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'sick' feeling is associated with the fight or flight response, which involves physiological changes like increased heart rate and adrenaline release"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the endocrine system regulate hormone levels in the bloodstream?",
      "options": [
        "Through nerve impulses",
        "By feedback mechanisms",
        "By direct electrical stimulation",
        "Through muscle contractions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system uses feedback mechanisms to regulate hormone levels, similar to how a thermostat controls temperature. This corresponds to: By feedback mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between the endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system during stress?",
      "options": [
        "They function independently",
        "They work in opposition",
        "They work in parallel",
        "They have no interaction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system and the autonomic nervous system work in parallel during stress, with the sympathetic nervous system activating the release of hormones. This corresponds to: They work in parallel."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the hypothalamus in the endocrine system?",
      "options": [
        "To produce adrenaline",
        "To regulate body temperature",
        "To activate the pituitary gland",
        "To control muscle movement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland, which then triggers the release of hormones from other glands in the endocrine system. This corresponds to: To activate the pituitary gland."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a methodological issue when studying the effects of hormones on behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Hormones are always present in the body",
        "Hormonal effects can vary widely between individuals",
        "Hormones have no effect on behavior",
        "Hormones are only produced in response to stress"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hormonal effects can vary widely between individuals, making it difficult to generalize findings across different populations"
