  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the endocrine system in the human body?",
      "options": [
        "To transmit electrical signals",
        "To regulate physiological processes through hormones",
        "To control voluntary movements",
        "To process sensory information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system regulates physiological processes through the release of hormones into the bloodstream. This corresponds to: To regulate physiological processes through hormones."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which gland is often referred to as the 'master gland' of the endocrine system?",
      "options": [
        "Adrenal gland",
        "Thyroid gland",
        "Pituitary gland",
        "Pancreas"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The pituitary gland is called the 'master gland' because it controls the release of hormones from other endocrine glands"
    },
    {
      "question": "During a stressful event, which hormone is primarily released by the adrenal medulla?",
      "options": [
        "Cortisol",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Adrenaline",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Adrenaline is released from the adrenal medulla in response to stress, preparing the body for the fight or flight response"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a person experiences increased heart rate and heightened alertness due to a perceived threat, which system is primarily responsible for this response?",
      "options": [
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Endocrine system",
        "Sympathetic nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for physiological arousal during stress, working alongside the endocrine system"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a student feels 'butterflies' in their stomach before an exam, which physiological response is likely occurring?",
      "options": [
        "Rest and digest response",
        "Fight or flight response",
        "Homeostasis",
        "Metabolic rate decrease"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The feeling of 'butterflies' indicates activation of the fight or flight response, involving adrenaline release"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the endocrine system maintain stable hormone levels in the bloodstream?",
      "options": [
        "Through feedback mechanisms",
        "By increasing hormone production constantly",
        "By using nerve impulses",
        "Through direct muscle action"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system uses feedback mechanisms to regulate hormone levels, similar to a thermostat controlling temperature. This corresponds to: Through feedback mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which hormone produced by the thyroid gland affects metabolic rates and growth?",
      "options": [
        "Adrenaline",
        "Cortisol",
        "Thyroxine",
        "Insulin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Thyroxine is produced by the thyroid gland and is crucial for regulating metabolic rates and growth"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue when studying the effects of hormones on behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Hormones can only be studied in isolation",
        "Hormonal effects can vary greatly between individuals",
        "Hormones have no impact on behavior",
        "Hormones act only in the short term"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hormonal effects can vary greatly between individuals, making it difficult to generalize findings across populations"
    },
    {
      "question": "In terms of response time, how does the endocrine system compare to the nervous system?",
      "options": [
        "Faster than the nervous system",
        "Slower than the nervous system",
        "Equally fast as the nervous system",
        "Not comparable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The endocrine system acts more slowly than the nervous system, although it has widespread effects. This corresponds to: Slower than the nervous system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the hypothalamus play in the endocrine system?",
      "options": [
        "It produces adrenaline",
        "It regulates the pituitary gland",
        "It secretes insulin",
        "It controls muscle movement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The hypothalamus regulates the pituitary gland by sending releasing hormones that trigger hormone secretion. This corresponds to: It regulates the pituitary gland."
