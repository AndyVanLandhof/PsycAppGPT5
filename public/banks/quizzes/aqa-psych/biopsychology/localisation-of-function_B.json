    {
      "question": "Which area of the brain is primarily associated with language production, as identified by Paul Broca in 1861?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's area",
        "Motor cortex",
        "Broca's area",
        "Somatosensory cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Broca's area is located in the left hemisphere and is crucial for language production"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Roger Sperry's split-brain research, what was found regarding the processing of visual information presented to the right visual field?",
      "options": [
        "Participants could verbally identify the object",
        "Participants could not identify the object",
        "Participants could only identify the object with their left hand",
        "Participants could identify the object but not describe it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Visual information in the right visual field is processed by the left hemisphere, which is responsible for speech. This corresponds to: Participants could verbally identify the object."
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with damage to Wernicke's area would likely experience difficulty in which of the following?",
      "options": [
        "Producing speech",
        "Understanding language",
        "Controlling movement",
        "Processing visual information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Wernicke's area is associated with language comprehension, so damage here affects understanding. This corresponds to: Understanding language."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher presents an object to the left visual field of a split-brain participant. What is the expected outcome regarding the participant's ability to respond?",
      "options": [
        "They can verbally identify the object",
        "They can select the object with their right hand",
        "They can select the object with their left hand",
        "They cannot respond at all"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The left visual field is processed by the right hemisphere, which does not control speech but can control the left hand. This corresponds to: They can select the object with their left hand."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of localisation of function in the brain?",
      "options": [
        "All brain areas work together for all functions",
        "Specific areas of the brain are responsible for specific functions",
        "The brain functions as a single unit without specialisation",
        "Brain functions are equally distributed across both hemispheres"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Localisation of function suggests that different brain areas are specialised for different tasks. This corresponds to: Specific areas of the brain are responsible for specific functions."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study of a patient with damage to the motor cortex, which function would most likely be impaired?",
      "options": [
        "Language comprehension",
        "Movement control",
        "Visual processing",
        "Emotional regulation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The motor cortex is responsible for controlling voluntary movements, so damage here would impair movement. This corresponds to: Movement control."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often raised regarding the generalisation of findings from split-brain research?",
      "options": [
        "The sample size is too large",
        "The participants are not representative of the general population",
        "The research lacks ethical considerations",
        "The tasks used are too simplistic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Participants in split-brain studies often have unique neurological conditions, making generalisation difficult. This corresponds to: The participants are not representative of the general population."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements about Broca's and Wernicke's areas is true?",
      "options": [
        "Both are located in the right hemisphere",
        "Broca's area is responsible for language production, while Wernicke's area is for comprehension",
        "Both areas are involved in emotional processing",
        "Broca's area is involved in visual processing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Broca's area is linked to language production, while Wernicke's area is associated with understanding language. This corresponds to: Broca's area is responsible for language production, while Wernicke's area is for comprehension."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the term 'cortical specialisation' refer to in the context of brain function?",
      "options": [
        "The brain's ability to recover from injury",
        "The idea that different brain areas perform different tasks",
        "The equal distribution of functions across the brain",
        "The process of learning new skills"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cortical specialisation is synonymous with localisation of function, where specific areas are dedicated to specific tasks. This corresponds to: The idea that different brain areas perform different tasks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of brain plasticity challenge traditional views of localisation of function?",
      "options": [
        "It suggests that brain functions are fixed and cannot change",
        "It indicates that brain areas can adapt and take on new functions after damage",
        "It confirms that each hemisphere has distinct and unchangeable roles",
        "It implies that all brain functions are equally distributed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Brain plasticity shows that the brain can reorganise itself, suggesting a more dynamic view of function than strict localisation. This corresponds to: It indicates that brain areas can adapt and take on new functions after damage."
