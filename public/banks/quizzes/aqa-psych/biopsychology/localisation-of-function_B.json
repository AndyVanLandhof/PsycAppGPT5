    {
      "question": "Which area of the brain is primarily associated with speech production, as identified by Broca in 1861?",
      "options": [
        "Wernicke's area",
        "Motor cortex",
        "Broca's area",
        "Somatosensory cortex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Broca's area is located in the left hemisphere and is crucial for speech production"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Roger Sperry's split-brain research, what was demonstrated about the left hemisphere's function?",
      "options": [
        "It controls the left hand",
        "It processes visual information from the right visual field",
        "It is responsible for emotional responses",
        "It regulates motor functions of the left leg"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Sperry's research showed that the left hemisphere processes information from the right visual field. This corresponds to: It processes visual information from the right visual field."
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with damage to Wernicke's area is likely to experience difficulties in which area?",
      "options": [
        "Understanding language",
        "Producing speech",
        "Motor control",
        "Visual processing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Wernicke's area is associated with language comprehension, so damage here affects understanding. This corresponds to: Understanding language."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a patient has a stroke affecting the motor cortex, which function is most likely to be impaired?",
      "options": [
        "Speech production",
        "Sensory perception",
        "Movement control",
        "Visual processing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The motor cortex is responsible for controlling voluntary movements, so impairment would affect movement. This corresponds to: Movement control."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, a participant could not name an object presented in their left visual field. What does this suggest about their brain function?",
      "options": [
        "The right hemisphere is dominant for language",
        "The left hemisphere is responsible for visual processing",
        "The left hemisphere controls speech",
        "The right hemisphere processes language"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This indicates that the left hemisphere, which is responsible for speech, did not receive the visual input. This corresponds to: The left hemisphere controls speech."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often raised regarding Sperry's split-brain research?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of control over variables",
        "Small sample size",
        "Ethical concerns regarding informed consent",
        "Use of animal subjects"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Sperry's research often involved a small number of participants, which limits the generalizability of the findings. This corresponds to: Small sample size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of localisation of function in the brain?",
      "options": [
        "All brain areas work together for all functions",
        "Specific functions are located in specific areas of the brain",
        "The brain's functions are random and not localized",
        "Only the left hemisphere is involved in language"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Localisation of function posits that different areas of the brain are responsible for different functions. This corresponds to: Specific functions are located in specific areas of the brain."
    },
    {
      "question": "A patient with damage to the left hemisphere may struggle with which of the following tasks?",
      "options": [
        "Recognizing faces",
        "Understanding spoken language",
        "Balancing on one leg",
        "Interpreting visual stimuli"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Damage to the left hemisphere can impair language comprehension, affecting the ability to understand spoken language. This corresponds to: Understanding spoken language."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a criticism of the simplistic view of left-brain versus right-brain functions?",
      "options": [
        "It ignores the role of the corpus callosum",
        "It overemphasizes the role of the right hemisphere",
        "It suggests that brain functions are completely separate",
        "It does not account for brain plasticity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The simplistic view fails to recognize that the brain is plastic and that both hemispheres can adapt and share functions. This corresponds to: It does not account for brain plasticity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which technique is commonly used to study the localisation of brain functions?",
      "options": [
        "fMRI",
        "CT scan",
        "X-ray",
        "Ultrasound"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow"
