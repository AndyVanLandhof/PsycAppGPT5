    {
      "question": "Which division of the nervous system is responsible for transmitting information from the CNS to muscles and glands?",
      "options": [
        "Central nervous system",
        "Peripheral nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Autonomic nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The peripheral nervous system relays nerve impulses from the CNS to the rest of the body"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a person is startled by a loud noise, which branch of the autonomic nervous system is primarily activated?",
      "options": [
        "Sympathetic",
        "Parasympathetic",
        "Somatic",
        "Central"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic branch prepares the body for a 'fight or flight' response in reaction to stress"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary function of the somatic nervous system?",
      "options": [
        "Regulating internal organs",
        "Transmitting sensory information to the CNS",
        "Controlling involuntary actions",
        "Managing hormonal responses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The somatic nervous system transmits information from receptor cells in the sense organs to the CNS. This corresponds to: Transmitting sensory information to the CNS."
    },
    {
      "question": "During a stressful situation, which system is responsible for increasing heart rate and blood pressure?",
      "options": [
        "Central nervous system",
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "Sympathetic nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The sympathetic nervous system activates the body's stress response, increasing heart rate and blood pressure"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a person is experiencing chronic stress, which system is activated after the initial adrenaline surge?",
      "options": [
        "Sympathetic nervous system",
        "Parasympathetic nervous system",
        "HPA axis",
        "Somatic nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The HPA axis is activated to manage prolonged stress, involving hormonal signals from the hypothalamus and pituitary gland"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which part of the nervous system is involved in voluntary muscle movements?",
      "options": [
        "Autonomic nervous system",
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system",
        "Peripheral nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The somatic nervous system is responsible for voluntary control of muscles"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to digestion when the sympathetic nervous system is activated?",
      "options": [
        "It speeds up",
        "It slows down",
        "It stops completely",
        "It remains unchanged"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When the sympathetic nervous system is activated, digestion is inhibited as the body prioritizes immediate survival. This corresponds to: It slows down."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which division of the nervous system is primarily responsible for involuntary bodily functions?",
      "options": [
        "Somatic nervous system",
        "Central nervous system",
        "Autonomic nervous system",
        "Peripheral nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary bodily functions such as heart rate and digestion"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the nervous system, what does the term 'autonomic' imply?",
      "options": [
        "Controlled voluntarily",
        "Operates involuntarily",
        "Requires conscious thought",
        "Is limited to the CNS"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The term 'autonomic' indicates that the system operates automatically without conscious control. This corresponds to: Operates involuntarily."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a methodological issue when studying the nervous system's response to stress?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of control over variables",
        "Over-reliance on self-report measures",
        "Inability to measure physiological changes",
        "Limited sample diversity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A lack of control over variables can lead to confounding factors that affect the reliability of findings in stress response studies"
