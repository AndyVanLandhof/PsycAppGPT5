    {
      "question": "Which neurotransmitter has been linked to increased aggression when present at low levels, according to Crockett et al. (2010)?",
      "options": [
        "Dopamine",
        "Serotonin",
        "Norepinephrine",
        "GABA"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Crockett et al. found that low levels of serotonin are associated with increased aggressive behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term for the genetic makeup of an individual, which influences their characteristics?",
      "options": [
        "Phenotype",
        "Genotype",
        "Allele",
        "Chromosome"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The genotype refers to the actual genetic makeup of an individual, while the phenotype is how these genes are expressed"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the biological approach, how do genes and the environment interact to influence behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Genes determine behavior without environmental influence.",
        "Environment solely shapes behavior without genetic influence.",
        "Genotype is expressed as phenotype, influenced by the environment.",
        "Behavior is entirely learned through conditioning."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The biological approach posits that genotype interacts with the environment to produce the phenotype, which is the observable expression of genes. This corresponds to: Genotype is expressed as phenotype, influenced by the environment.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of phenotype?",
      "options": [
        "The genetic code of an organism",
        "The observable characteristics of an organism",
        "The potential for an organism's traits",
        "The hereditary information passed from parents"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Phenotype refers to the observable characteristics that result from the interaction of genotype with the environment. This corresponds to: The observable characteristics of an organism."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue does the biological approach face regarding the determinism of behavior?",
      "options": [
        "It ignores the role of environmental factors.",
        "It relies solely on self-report data.",
        "It cannot be tested scientifically.",
        "It assumes all behavior is learned."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The biological approach is criticized for being overly deterministic, as it suggests behavior is governed by genetic factors without considering environmental influences. This corresponds to: It ignores the role of environmental factors.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which study supports the idea that genetic factors influence mate preferences across cultures?",
      "options": [
        "Bandura's Bobo Doll Experiment",
        "Buss's study on mate preferences",
        "Pavlov's classical conditioning",
        "Skinner's operant conditioning research"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Buss's study demonstrated universal similarities in mate preferences across 37 cultures, suggesting a genetic basis for these behaviors. This corresponds to: Buss's study on mate preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the biological approach explain the relationship between aggression and neurotransmitters?",
      "options": [
        "Aggression is solely learned through observation.",
        "Neurotransmitter imbalances can lead to aggressive behavior.",
        "Aggression is a result of environmental conditioning.",
        "All aggression is inherited."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach posits that imbalances in neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, can lead to increased aggression. This corresponds to: Neurotransmitter imbalances can lead to aggressive behavior.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the biological approach regarding its view on behavior?",
      "options": [
        "It overemphasizes environmental factors.",
        "It is too simplistic and ignores environmental influences.",
        "It does not consider genetic factors.",
        "It lacks empirical support."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach is often criticized for being too simplistic, as it tends to overlook the mediating effects of the environment on behavior. This corresponds to: It is too simplistic and ignores environmental influences.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements best describes the role of neurochemistry in the biological approach?",
      "options": [
        "It is unrelated to psychological functioning.",
        "It plays a crucial role in understanding behavior through chemical changes.",
        "It only influences physical health.",
        "It is solely responsible for learned behaviors."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach emphasizes the importance of neurochemistry in understanding behavior, particularly through chemical changes in the nervous system. This corresponds to: It plays a crucial role in understanding behavior through chemical changes.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the biological approach suggest about the nature-nurture debate?",
      "options": [
        "Behavior is entirely determined by genetics.",
        "Behavior is solely shaped by environmental experiences.",
        "Both genetic and environmental factors interact to shape behavior.",
        "Behavior is predetermined by cultural influences."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The biological approach argues that behavior results from an interaction between inherited genetic factors (nature) and environmental influences (nurture). This corresponds to: Both genetic and environmental factors interact to shape behavior.."
