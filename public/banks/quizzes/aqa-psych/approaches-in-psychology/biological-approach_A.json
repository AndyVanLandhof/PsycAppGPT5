    {
      "question": "What does the biological approach suggest about the influence of neurotransmitters on behavior?",
      "options": [
        "They have no impact on behavior.",
        "They are solely responsible for behavior.",
        "Imbalances can lead to behavioral issues.",
        "They only affect physical health."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The biological approach argues that imbalances of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, can lead to various behavioral issues, including aggression and depression. This corresponds to: Imbalances can lead to behavioral issues.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the biological approach, what is the difference between genotype and phenotype?",
      "options": [
        "Genotype is the observable trait, phenotype is the genetic makeup.",
        "Genotype is the genetic makeup, phenotype is the observable trait.",
        "Both are the same.",
        "Phenotype refers to inherited traits only."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Genotype refers to an individual's genetic makeup, while phenotype is how these genes are expressed through observable traits. This corresponds to: Genotype is the genetic makeup, phenotype is the observable trait.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Crockett et al. (2010) found a link between low levels of serotonin and which behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Increased aggression",
        "Decreased aggression",
        "Improved mood",
        "Enhanced memory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Crockett et al. found that low levels of serotonin were associated with increased aggression"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher studies twins to understand the genetic basis of intelligence. What aspect of the biological approach is this research likely examining?",
      "options": [
        "The role of the environment",
        "The influence of neurochemistry",
        "The genetic basis of behavior",
        "The impact of social learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This research examines the genetic basis of behavior by comparing intelligence levels in twins, which can reveal hereditary influences"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the biological approach view the role of the environment in shaping behavior?",
      "options": [
        "It is the only factor.",
        "It has no influence.",
        "It interacts with genetic factors.",
        "It is less important than genetics."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The biological approach posits that while genetics play a crucial role, the expression of these genes (phenotype) is influenced by environmental factors. This corresponds to: It interacts with genetic factors.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the biological approach regarding its determinist perspective?",
      "options": [
        "It ignores genetic factors.",
        "It oversimplifies complex behaviors.",
        "It does not consider environmental influences.",
        "It is not based on scientific evidence."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach's determinist perspective can oversimplify complex behaviors by attributing them solely to genetic factors, ignoring the role of the environment. This corresponds to: It oversimplifies complex behaviors.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of 'evolution' in the biological approach?",
      "options": [
        "It is unrelated to behavior.",
        "It explains how behaviors can be adaptive.",
        "It only applies to physical traits.",
        "It contradicts genetic influences."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach incorporates evolutionary theory to explain how certain behaviors may have adaptive significance, such as mate selection. This corresponds to: It explains how behaviors can be adaptive.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the biological approach suggest about the relationship between genes and behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Genes have no effect on behavior.",
        "Behavior is entirely learned.",
        "Genes provide a blueprint that interacts with the environment.",
        "Behavior is solely determined by environmental factors."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The biological approach suggests that genes provide a blueprint for behavior, but their expression is influenced by environmental interactions. This corresponds to: Genes provide a blueprint that interacts with the environment.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In comparing the biological approach to the learning approaches, what key difference is highlighted?",
      "options": [
        "Both emphasize the role of genetics.",
        "The biological approach focuses on inherited factors, while learning approaches emphasize environmental factors.",
        "Both approaches ignore environmental influences.",
        "The learning approaches are more scientific."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach emphasizes inherited genetic factors, whereas learning approaches focus on behavior as a result of environmental influences. This corresponds to: The biological approach focuses on inherited factors, while learning approaches emphasize environmental factors.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following studies supports the biological approach's view on the genetic basis of behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Bandura's Bobo Doll experiment",
        "Crockett et al.'s study on serotonin",
        "Pavlov's classical conditioning",
        "Skinner's operant conditioning research"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Crockett et al.'s study supports the biological approach by linking low serotonin levels to increased aggression, highlighting the genetic influence on behavior. This corresponds to: Crockett et al.'s study on serotonin."
