      "question": "A researcher uses fMRI to study the brain activity of participants while they recall episodic memories. This is an example of which approach?",
      "options": [
        "Behaviorist",
        "Cognitive",
        "Humanistic",

      "question": "A study finds that the parahippocampal gyrus is linked to processing unpleasant emotions in individuals with OCD. What does this illustrate about cognitive neuroscience?",
      "options": [
        "It focuses solely on behavior.",
        "It examines the biological basis of mental disorders.",
        "It ignores brain structures.",
        "It only uses theoretical models."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This finding illustrates how cognitive neuroscience links specific brain structures to mental disorders. This corresponds to: It examines the biological basis of mental disorders.."

      "question": "What is a potential limitation of using neuroimaging techniques like fMRI in cognitive neuroscience research?",
      "options": [
        "They are too expensive.",
        "They can only be used on animals.",
        "They may not accurately reflect real-time brain activity.",
        "They do not provide any data."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Neuroimaging techniques may not accurately reflect real-time brain activity due to the time lag in blood flow changes. This corresponds to: They may not accurately reflect real-time brain activity.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the role of schemas in cognitive psychology?",
      "options": [
        "They are fixed responses to stimuli.",
        "They are frameworks for organizing and interpreting information.",
        "They are purely biological processes.",
        "They are unconscious drives."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Schemas are cognitive frameworks that help individuals organize and interpret information based on past experiences. This corresponds to: They are frameworks for organizing and interpreting information.."
