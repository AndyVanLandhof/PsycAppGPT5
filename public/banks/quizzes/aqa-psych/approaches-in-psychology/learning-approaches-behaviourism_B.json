    {
      "question": "What is the primary focus of the behaviourist approach in psychology?",
      "options": [
        "Mental processes",
        "Observable behaviour",
        "Emotional responses",
        "Biological factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach focuses solely on observable behaviour and rejects the study of mental processes"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Pavlov's classical conditioning experiment, what was the unconditioned stimulus?",
      "options": [
        "The bell",
        "The food",
        "The salivation",
        "The dog"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Pavlov's experiment, the food was the unconditioned stimulus that naturally elicited salivation"
    },
    {
      "question": "A student hands in an essay to avoid being told off. This is an example of which type of reinforcement?",
      "options": [
        "Positive reinforcement",
        "Negative reinforcement",
        "Punishment",
        "Conditioned response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates negative reinforcement, where the student avoids an unpleasant consequence"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Skinner's research primarily demonstrate about operant conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Learning through observation",
        "Learning through association",
        "Learning through rewards and punishments",
        "Learning through innate responses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Skinner's research showed that behaviour is shaped by its consequences, specifically through rewards and punishments. This corresponds to: Learning through rewards and punishments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of 'flavour-flavour learning'?",
      "options": [
        "Learning to avoid certain foods",
        "Developing a preference for new foods based on existing preferences",
        "Conditioning through punishment",
        "Associating sounds with food"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Flavour-flavour learning refers to developing a preference for new foods due to their association with flavours we already like. This corresponds to: Developing a preference for new foods based on existing preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "A child is rewarded with praise for eating vegetables. This scenario illustrates which aspect of operant conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Positive reinforcement",
        "Negative reinforcement",
        "Punishment",
        "Conditioned response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The praise serves as positive reinforcement, increasing the likelihood that the child will eat vegetables again"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often associated with the behaviourist approach?",
      "options": [
        "Overemphasis on cognitive processes",
        "Neglect of biological influences",
        "Reliance on self-report data",
        "Focus on subjective experiences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach is criticized for neglecting biological influences on behaviour, focusing solely on learned experiences. This corresponds to: Neglect of biological influences."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of classical conditioning, what is a conditioned response?",
      "options": [
        "A natural reaction to a stimulus",
        "A learned reaction to a previously neutral stimulus",
        "An unlearned behaviour",
        "A response to punishment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A conditioned response is a learned reaction that occurs in response to a previously neutral stimulus after conditioning. This corresponds to: A learned reaction to a previously neutral stimulus."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the behaviourist approach view the role of free will in human behaviour?",
      "options": [
        "It emphasizes free will",
        "It denies the existence of free will",
        "It suggests limited free will",
        "It promotes the idea of conscious decision-making"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach denies the existence of free will, suggesting that behaviour is conditioned by external stimuli. This corresponds to: It denies the existence of free will."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between classical conditioning and operant conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "One involves rewards, the other involves associations",
        "One is passive, the other is active",
        "One is for animals, the other is for humans",
        "One is based on observation, the other on reinforcement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Classical conditioning is a passive process of learning through association, while operant conditioning is an active process shaped by rewards and punishments. This corresponds to: One is passive, the other is active."
