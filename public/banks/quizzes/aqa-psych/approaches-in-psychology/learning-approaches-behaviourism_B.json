    {
      "question": "What is the primary focus of the behaviourist approach in psychology?",
      "options": [
        "Mental processes",
        "Observable behaviour",
        "Emotional responses",
        "Cognitive development"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach is primarily concerned with studying observable behaviour rather than internal mental processes"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Pavlov's classical conditioning experiment, what was the unconditioned stimulus?",
      "options": [
        "The bell",
        "The food",
        "The salivation",
        "The dog"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Pavlov's experiment, the food was the unconditioned stimulus that naturally elicited a salivation response from the dogs"
    },
    {
      "question": "A student receives praise from their teacher for answering a question correctly. This scenario illustrates which type of operant conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Negative reinforcement",
        "Positive reinforcement",
        "Punishment",
        "Extinction"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The praise serves as a positive reinforcement, increasing the likelihood that the student will answer questions correctly in the future"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the outcome of negative reinforcement in operant conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Increases behaviour by adding a pleasant stimulus",
        "Decreases behaviour by adding an unpleasant stimulus",
        "Increases behaviour by removing an unpleasant stimulus",
        "Decreases behaviour by removing a pleasant stimulus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Negative reinforcement increases the likelihood of a behaviour being repeated by removing an unpleasant stimulus. This corresponds to: Increases behaviour by removing an unpleasant stimulus."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, a child is rewarded with stickers for eating vegetables. This is an example of which learning principle?",
      "options": [
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Social learning",
        "Cognitive learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario exemplifies operant conditioning, where the child is reinforced for a specific behaviour (eating vegetables) with a reward (stickers)"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often associated with the behaviourist approach?",
      "options": [
        "Overemphasis on cognitive processes",
        "Neglect of biological factors",
        "Reliance on self-report data",
        "Focus on qualitative research"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach is often criticized for neglecting biological factors that may influence behaviour, focusing solely on learned responses. This corresponds to: Neglect of biological factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of 'flavour-flavour learning'?",
      "options": [
        "Learning to associate a neutral stimulus with a response",
        "Developing a preference for new foods through association with liked flavours",
        "Avoiding unpleasant stimuli through learned behaviour",
        "Reinforcing behaviour through rewards"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Flavour-flavour learning involves developing a preference for new foods based on their association with flavours that are already liked. This corresponds to: Developing a preference for new foods through association with liked flavours."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Skinner's research, what was the purpose of the Skinner box?",
      "options": [
        "To measure cognitive processes",
        "To observe social learning",
        "To study operant conditioning",
        "To investigate classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Skinner box was designed to study operant conditioning by observing how animals learn to operate on their environment for rewards"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of using animal studies, such as those conducted by Pavlov and Skinner, to explain human behaviour?",
      "options": [
        "They provide too much detail",
        "They ignore environmental influences",
        "They may not account for human cognitive processes",
        "They are too complex"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Animal studies may not fully account for the cognitive processes involved in human behaviour, limiting the generalizability of the findings. This corresponds to: They may not account for human cognitive processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to behaviourists, how is a child's attachment to a caregiver primarily formed?",
      "options": [
        "Through genetic predisposition",
        "By emotional bonding",
        "Via classical and operant conditioning",
        "Through social learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Behaviourists propose that a child's attachment to a caregiver is formed through classical and operant conditioning, emphasizing learned behaviours. This corresponds to: Via classical and operant conditioning."
