    {
      "question": "What is the primary concept of Bandura's Social Learning Theory as proposed in 1977?",
      "options": [
        "Learning through direct reinforcement only",
        "Learning through observation and imitation",
        "Learning through classical conditioning",
        "Learning through operant conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bandura's Social Learning Theory emphasizes that individuals learn by observing the behaviors of others and the outcomes of those behaviors. This corresponds to: Learning through observation and imitation."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Bandura's 1961 study, what behavior did children imitate after observing a model?",
      "options": [
        "Aggressive behavior towards a doll",
        "Cooperative behavior with peers",
        "Calm behavior in stressful situations",
        "Avoidance of aggressive models"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In Bandura's 1961 study, children imitated aggressive behavior towards a doll after observing a model acting aggressively"
    },
    {
      "question": "A child observes their parent showing affection by hugging and kissing. According to social learning theory, what is this an example of?",
      "options": [
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Modelling",
        "Classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates modelling, where the child learns attachment behaviors by observing their parent's affectionate actions"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a child learns to say 'thank you' after observing their parent receive a reward for the same behavior, which concept from social learning theory is illustrated?",
      "options": [
        "Identification",
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Operant conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario demonstrates vicarious reinforcement, where the child learns behavior by observing the positive outcomes of the parent's actions"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a methodological criticism of Bandura's research on social learning?",
      "options": [
        "It lacked ecological validity",
        "It was conducted in a natural setting",
        "It used a large sample size",
        "It focused on long-term behavior change"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "A common criticism of Bandura's research is that it lacked ecological validity, as the laboratory setting may not reflect real-life situations"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does social learning theory differ from the behaviorist approach in terms of learning?",
      "options": [
        "It emphasizes direct reinforcement only",
        "It includes observational learning",
        "It ignores the role of the environment",
        "It focuses solely on internal processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social learning theory incorporates observational learning, whereas the behaviorist approach primarily focuses on direct reinforcement and conditioning. This corresponds to: It includes observational learning."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Bandura's social learning theory, what role do mediational processes play?",
      "options": [
        "They are irrelevant to learning",
        "They determine the effectiveness of reinforcement",
        "They influence the observation and imitation of behaviors",
        "They replace the need for modeling"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Mediational processes are crucial in social learning theory as they influence how individuals observe and imitate behaviors. This corresponds to: They influence the observation and imitation of behaviors."
    },
    {
      "question": "A teenager starts smoking after seeing their peers do so and receiving social approval. This scenario illustrates which aspect of social learning theory?",
      "options": [
        "Identification",
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario exemplifies vicarious reinforcement, where the teenager learns the behavior through observing the positive social outcomes for their peers"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Bandura's concept of reciprocal determinism suggest about behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Behavior is solely determined by genetics",
        "Behavior is influenced by the environment and personal choices",
        "Behavior is fixed and unchangeable",
        "Behavior is only learned through direct experience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Reciprocal determinism posits that behavior is influenced by both the environment and the individual's choices, highlighting a two-way interaction. This corresponds to: Behavior is influenced by the environment and personal choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the term 'identification' in the context of social learning theory?",
      "options": [
        "Learning through direct reinforcement",
        "Desiring to be like a role model",
        "Imitating behaviors without understanding",
        "Avoiding behaviors seen in others"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In social learning theory, 'identification' refers to the desire to be like a role model, which can lead to the imitation of their behaviors. This corresponds to: Desiring to be like a role model."
