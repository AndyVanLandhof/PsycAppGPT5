    {
      "question": "What is the main concept of Bandura's social learning theory as proposed in 1977?",
      "options": [
        "Learning occurs through direct reinforcement only.",
        "Learning occurs through observation and imitation of role models.",
        "Learning is solely a cognitive process.",
        "Learning is based on genetic predispositions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bandura's social learning theory emphasizes that individuals learn by observing the behaviors and outcomes of role models. This corresponds to: Learning occurs through observation and imitation of role models.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Bandura's 1961 study, what behavior did children imitate after observing an adult model?",
      "options": [
        "Helping behavior",
        "Aggressive behavior",
        "Pro-social behavior",
        "Passive behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Bandura's 1961 study, children imitated aggressive behavior after observing an adult model acting aggressively towards a Bobo doll"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes Learning approaches: Social Learning Theory (Bandura)?",
      "options": [
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Modelling",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Cognitive dissonance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates modelling, where the child imitates the affectionate behavior observed in their parent"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes 'vicarious reinforcement' in the context of social learning theory?",
      "options": [
        "Learning through direct rewards.",
        "Learning by observing the consequences of others' actions.",
        "Learning that occurs without any role models.",
        "Learning that is solely cognitive."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Vicarious reinforcement refers to learning that occurs by observing the consequences of another person's behavior. This corresponds to: Learning by observing the consequences of others' actions.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study where children were exposed to aggressive and non-aggressive models, what was the primary finding regarding the children's behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Children only imitate non-aggressive models.",
        "Children exposed to aggressive models showed more aggression.",
        "Children do not imitate any models.",
        "Children's behavior was unaffected by the models."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The primary finding was that children exposed to aggressive models exhibited more aggressive behavior themselves. This corresponds to: Children exposed to aggressive models showed more aggression.."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that children who watch violent cartoons are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior. This supports which aspect of social learning theory?",
      "options": [
        "The role of reinforcement",
        "The importance of cognitive processes",
        "The influence of observational learning",
        "The impact of genetic factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This finding supports the influence of observational learning, where children learn behaviors by watching others, in this case, violent cartoons"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often raised regarding Bandura's research on social learning?",
      "options": [
        "The use of self-report measures",
        "The ecological validity of the laboratory setting",
        "The lack of control over variables",
        "The sample size used in the study"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A common methodological issue is the ecological validity of Bandura's laboratory setting, which may not reflect real-world situations. This corresponds to: The ecological validity of the laboratory setting."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does social learning theory differ from the behaviorist approach?",
      "options": [
        "Social learning theory ignores cognitive processes.",
        "Social learning theory emphasizes observational learning.",
        "Behaviorism focuses on internal mental processes.",
        "Behaviorism includes vicarious reinforcement."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social learning theory emphasizes observational learning and the role of cognitive processes, whereas behaviorism focuses primarily on direct reinforcement. This corresponds to: Social learning theory emphasizes observational learning.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following terms refers to the process of identifying with a role model in social learning theory?",
      "options": [
        "Imitation",
        "Identification",
        "Modelling",
        "Reinforcement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Identification refers to the process where individuals relate to and want to be like a role model, influencing their behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Bandura's social learning theory, what role do 'mediational processes' play?",
      "options": [
        "They are irrelevant to learning.",
        "They determine the effectiveness of reinforcement.",
        "They mediate between observation and imitation.",
        "They are only applicable to cognitive learning."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Mediational processes are cognitive factors that mediate between observing a behavior and imitating it, crucial for understanding social learning. This corresponds to: They mediate between observation and imitation.."
