    {
      "question": "What does the information processing approach suggest about how information flows through the cognitive system?",
      "options": [
        "It is random and unpredictable.",
        "It flows in a sequence of stages.",
        "It is solely based on emotional responses.",
        "It is influenced by social interactions."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The information processing approach suggests that information flows through the cognitive system in a sequence of stages, including input, storage, and retrieval. This corresponds to: It flows in a sequence of stages.."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the role of schemas in cognitive psychology?",
      "options": [
        "They are fixed and unchangeable.",
        "They help individuals process and interpret information.",
        "They are only relevant to memory recall.",
        "They are irrelevant to understanding behavior."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Schemas are cognitive frameworks that help individuals process and interpret information, influencing how we understand the world. This corresponds to: They help individuals process and interpret information.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study examining the effects of cognitive models on memory, participants were asked to recall a list of words. What aspect of cognitive psychology does this scenario illustrate?",
      "options": [
        "The role of reinforcement.",
        "The importance of observational learning.",
        "The process of encoding and retrieval.",
        "The influence of the unconscious mind."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates the cognitive processes of encoding and retrieval, which are central to understanding how memory works. This corresponds to: The process of encoding and retrieval.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key difference between computer models and human cognitive processing?",
      "options": [
        "Humans process information faster than computers.",
        "Computers do not make mistakes, while humans do.",
        "Humans can store unlimited information.",
        "Computer models are based on emotional responses."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A key difference is that computers do not make mistakes or forget information, whereas human cognitive processing is prone to errors and memory limitations. This corresponds to: Computers do not make mistakes, while humans do.."

    {
      "question": "Which cognitive model was first proposed by Baddeley and Hitch in 1974?",
      "options": [
        "Multi-store model.",
        "Working memory model.",
        "Information processing model.",
        "Schema theory."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The working memory model was first proposed by Baddeley and Hitch in 1974, outlining how information is temporarily held and manipulated. This corresponds to: Working memory model.."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do cognitive psychologists use computer models to understand mental processes?",
      "options": [
        "By ignoring emotional factors.",
        "By programming computers to replicate human thought.",
        "By focusing solely on observable behavior.",
        "By emphasizing the role of the unconscious."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cognitive psychologists use computer models by programming computers to replicate human thought processes, allowing for comparisons between human and machine processing. This corresponds to: By programming computers to replicate human thought.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often associated with cognitive psychology research?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of scientific rigor.",
        "Overemphasis on emotional factors.",
        "Tasks may lack ecological validity.",
        "Neglect of biological influences."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Many cognitive psychology studies use tasks that are relatively meaningless in real-life settings, raising concerns about their ecological validity. This corresponds to: Tasks may lack ecological validity.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the episodic buffer in Baddeleyâ€™s working memory model?",
      "options": [
        "It is the primary storage component.",
        "It integrates information from different sources.",
        "It is responsible for long-term memory.",
        "It has no significant role."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The episodic buffer, added by Baddeley in 2000, integrates information from different sources, linking the working memory to long-term memory. This corresponds to: It integrates information from different sources.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following statements about cognitive psychology is true?",
      "options": [
        "It focuses exclusively on observable behavior.",
        "It ignores internal mental processes.",
        "It uses scientific methods to study mental processes.",
        "It is based solely on psychoanalytic theory."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Cognitive psychology is scientific and uses the scientific method to study internal mental processes, contrasting with behaviorist approaches. This corresponds to: It uses scientific methods to study mental processes.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do mediating cognitive variables play in social learning theory?",
      "options": [
        "They are irrelevant to learning.",
        "They determine which models are imitated.",
        "They only affect behavior in adults.",
        "They are fixed and unchangeable."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mediating cognitive variables influence which models children choose to imitate through observation, highlighting the cognitive aspect of social learning. This corresponds to: They determine which models are imitated.."
