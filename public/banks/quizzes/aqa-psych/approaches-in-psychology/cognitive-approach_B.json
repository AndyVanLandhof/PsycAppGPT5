    {
      "question": "What does the information processing approach in cognitive psychology suggest about how information flows through the cognitive system?",
      "options": [
        "It is random and unpredictable.",
        "It flows in a sequence of stages including input, storage, and retrieval.",
        "It only involves storage and retrieval.",
        "It is solely based on emotional responses."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The information processing approach suggests that information flows through the cognitive system in a sequence of stages, including input, storage, and retrieval. This corresponds to: It flows in a sequence of stages including input, storage, and retrieval.."

      "question": "Which model was first proposed by Baddeley and Hitch in 1974 and includes components for processing information?",
      "options": [
        "Multi-store model",
        "Working memory model",
        "Schema theory",
        "Cognitive neuroscience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The working memory model was first proposed by Baddeley and Hitch in 1974 and includes components for processing information"

      "question": "In a study where children observe adults interacting with toys, which cognitive variable is highlighted in Bandura's research on social learning?",
      "options": [
        "Imitation",
        "Reinforcement",
        "Memory",
        "Attention"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Bandura's research emphasizes imitation as children observe adults and then replicate their behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that children who watch more violent television shows tend to exhibit more aggressive behavior. This supports which aspect of social learning theory?",
      "options": [
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Cognitive schemas",
        "Information processing",
        "Biological predisposition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates vicarious reinforcement, where children learn behaviors by observing the consequences of others' actions"
    },
    {
      "question": "A cognitive psychologist uses a computer model to simulate human memory processes. What is a key limitation of this approach?",
      "options": [
        "It accurately reflects human emotions.",
        "It does not account for mistakes made by humans.",
        "It is too complex to understand.",
        "It ignores the role of schemas."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A key limitation is that computer models do not make mistakes, unlike humans, which limits their appropriateness for explaining human thought. This corresponds to: It does not account for mistakes made by humans.."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the role of schemas in cognitive psychology?",
      "options": [
        "They are fixed and unchangeable.",
        "They help individuals interpret and organize information.",
        "They are irrelevant to memory processes.",
        "They only apply to social learning."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Schemas help individuals interpret and organize information, influencing how we perceive and respond to new experiences. This corresponds to: They help individuals interpret and organize information.."

      "question": "In a study examining eyewitness testimony, researchers found that misleading information can alter a person's memory of an event. This finding highlights which aspect of cognitive psychology?",
      "options": [
        "The reliability of memory",
        "The role of reinforcement",
        "The importance of schemas",
        "The influence of biological factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This finding highlights the reliability of memory and how it can be influenced by external factors, such as misleading information"

      "question": "What is a significant difference between human information processing and computer processing?",
      "options": [
        "Humans process information faster than computers.",
        "Computers can forget information, while humans cannot.",
        "Humans can make mistakes and ignore information, while computers do not.",
        "Human processing is more logical than computer processing."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Humans can make mistakes and ignore information, which is a significant difference from how computers process information. This corresponds to: Humans can make mistakes and ignore information, while computers do not.."
