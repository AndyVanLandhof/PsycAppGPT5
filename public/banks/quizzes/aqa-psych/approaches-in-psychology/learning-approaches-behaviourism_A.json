    {
      "question": "What is the primary focus of the behaviourist approach in psychology?",
      "options": [
        "Mental processes",
        "Observable behaviour",
        "Emotional responses",
        "Cognitive development"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach focuses solely on observable behaviour, rejecting the study of mental processes"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Pavlov's classical conditioning experiment, what was the unconditioned stimulus?",
      "options": [
        "The bell",
        "The food",
        "The salivation response",
        "The dog"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Pavlov's experiment, the food was the unconditioned stimulus that naturally elicited a salivation response"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of reinforcement involves avoiding an unpleasant experience?",
      "options": [
        "Positive reinforcement",
        "Negative reinforcement",
        "Punishment",
        "Conditioned response"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Negative reinforcement occurs when a behaviour is strengthened by the removal of an unpleasant stimulus"
    },
    {
      "question": "A child receives praise from their parent for eating vegetables. This is an example of which type of conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Social learning",
        "Cognitive learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates operant conditioning, where the child is reinforced for a specific behaviour (eating vegetables)"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Skinner's research demonstrate about operant conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Learning occurs through observation",
        "Behaviour is shaped by its consequences",
        "All behaviour is innate",
        "Conditioning is irrelevant to behaviour"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Skinner's research showed that behaviour is shaped by its consequences, highlighting the role of reinforcement and punishment"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, a rat learns to press a lever to receive food. This is an example of which conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Social learning",
        "Cognitive learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario exemplifies operant conditioning, where the rat learns to perform a behaviour to receive a reward"
    },
    {
      "question": "One criticism of the behaviourist approach is that it ignores which aspect of human experience?",
      "options": [
        "Biological influences",
        "Cognitive processes",
        "Social interactions",
        "Emotional responses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach is criticized for neglecting cognitive processes, focusing solely on observable behaviour"
    },
    {
      "question": "Flavour-flavour learning suggests that we develop food preferences based on what?",
      "options": [
        "Innate tastes",
        "Social influences",
        "Associations with liked flavours",
        "Nutritional value"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Flavour-flavour learning indicates that we prefer new foods due to their association with flavours we already enjoy. This corresponds to: Associations with liked flavours."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological strength of Skinner's research on operant conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Use of self-report measures",
        "Controlled laboratory settings",
        "Longitudinal studies",
        "Naturalistic observations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Skinner's use of controlled laboratory settings allows for high levels of control and objectivity in measuring behaviour"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to behaviourists, what is the nature of human behaviour?",
      "options": [
        "Innate and instinctual",
        "Learned through experience",
        "Unconscious and repressed",
        "Cognitive and rational"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Behaviourists argue that all human behaviour is learned through experiences, viewing individuals as 'blank slates'"
