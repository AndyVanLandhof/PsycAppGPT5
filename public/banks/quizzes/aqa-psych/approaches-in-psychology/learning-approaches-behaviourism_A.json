    {
      "question": "What is the primary focus of the behaviourist approach in psychology?",
      "options": [
        "Mental processes",
        "Observable behaviour",
        "Emotional responses",
        "Biological factors"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach is primarily concerned with studying observable behaviour rather than mental processes"
    },
    {
      "question": "In Pavlov's classical conditioning experiment, what was the unconditioned stimulus?",
      "options": [
        "The bell",
        "The food",
        "The salivation",
        "The dog"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In Pavlov's experiment, the food was the unconditioned stimulus that naturally elicited a salivation response"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Skinner's operant conditioning, what is positive reinforcement?",
      "options": [
        "Avoiding an unpleasant experience",
        "Receiving a reward for a behaviour",
        "Punishing undesirable behaviour",
        "Ignoring a behaviour"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Positive reinforcement involves receiving a reward when a certain behaviour is performed, increasing the likelihood of that behaviour being repeated. This corresponds to: Receiving a reward for a behaviour."
    },
    {
      "question": "A child receives praise from their parents for eating vegetables. This is an example of which type of conditioning?",
      "options": [
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Social learning",
        "Cognitive learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates operant conditioning, where the child is reinforced for a specific behaviour (eating vegetables) through praise"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological limitation of the behaviourist approach?",
      "options": [
        "Focus on mental processes",
        "Use of lab studies",
        "Neglect of biological factors",
        "Overemphasis on social influences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach often relies on lab studies, which may lack ecological validity and not reflect real-world behaviours. This corresponds to: Use of lab studies."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of flavour-flavour learning, what does this principle suggest about food preferences?",
      "options": [
        "Food preferences are innate",
        "Food preferences are learned through social interactions",
        "Food preferences develop through association with liked flavours",
        "Food preferences are solely based on nutritional value"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Flavour-flavour learning suggests that we develop a preference for new foods through their association with flavours we already like. This corresponds to: Food preferences develop through association with liked flavours."
    },
    {
      "question": "A rat learns to press a lever to receive food in a Skinner box. What type of conditioning is this an example of?",
      "options": [
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Social learning",
        "Cognitive learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario exemplifies operant conditioning, where behaviour is shaped by its consequences, such as receiving food"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the behaviourist approach suggest about human behaviour?",
      "options": [
        "It is primarily influenced by genetics",
        "It is learned through experience",
        "It is determined by unconscious processes",
        "It is shaped by cognitive processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach posits that all human behaviour is learned rather than inborn, viewing individuals as 'blank slates'. This corresponds to: It is learned through experience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a criticism of the behaviourist approach regarding the concept of free will?",
      "options": [
        "It overemphasizes free will",
        "It denies the existence of free will",
        "It supports the idea of free will",
        "It is neutral on free will"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The behaviourist approach suggests that behaviour is conditioned by external factors, implying that individuals do not have true free will. This corresponds to: It denies the existence of free will."
    },
    {
      "question": "In operant conditioning, what is the effect of punishment on behaviour?",
      "options": [
        "It increases the likelihood of behaviour",
        "It has no effect on behaviour",
        "It decreases the likelihood of behaviour",
        "It reinforces positive behaviour"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Punishment is intended to decrease the likelihood of a behaviour being repeated by providing an unpleasant consequence. This corresponds to: It decreases the likelihood of behaviour."
