    {
      "question": "What is the primary concept of Bandura's Social Learning Theory as proposed in 1977?",
      "options": [
        "Learning through reinforcement only",
        "Learning through observation and imitation",
        "Learning through classical conditioning",
        "Learning through operant conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bandura's Social Learning Theory emphasizes that people learn by observing the attitudes and behaviors of role models and the outcomes of those behaviors. This corresponds to: Learning through observation and imitation."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Bandura's 1961 study, what behavior was primarily transmitted through imitation?",
      "options": [
        "Aggression",
        "Fear",
        "Joy",
        "Sadness"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Bandura's 1961 study demonstrated that aggression could be transmitted through the imitation of aggressive models"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes Learning approaches: Social Learning Theory (Bandura)?",
      "options": [
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Identification",
        "Modelling",
        "Classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The child imitating the affectionate behavior of the parent exemplifies the concept of modelling in Social Learning Theory"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a key feature of Bandura's Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Cognitive dissonance",
        "Mediational processes",
        "Classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Mediational processes are a key feature of Bandura's Social Learning Theory, highlighting the cognitive factors involved in learning"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, children who observed aggressive behavior were more likely to act aggressively themselves. This supports which aspect of Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "The role of reinforcement",
        "The role of observation",
        "The role of genetics",
        "The role of classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario supports the role of observation in Social Learning Theory, where children learn behaviors by watching others"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often associated with Bandura's research on Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of ecological validity",
        "Over-reliance on qualitative data",
        "Insufficient sample size",
        "Use of self-report measures"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Bandura's studies, particularly the Bobo doll experiment, have been criticized for lacking ecological validity due to the artificial setting. This corresponds to: Lack of ecological validity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which term describes the process by which individuals adopt behaviors exhibited by role models in Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "Reinforcement",
        "Imitation",
        "Conditioning",
        "Generalization"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Imitation is the process through which individuals adopt behaviors they observe in role models, a core concept of Social Learning Theory"
    },
    {
      "question": "A teenager starts smoking after seeing friends do it and observing them being accepted socially. This scenario illustrates which concept of Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Cognitive restructuring",
        "Classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The teenager's behavior reflects vicarious reinforcement, where they learn from observing the social acceptance their friends receive"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Social Learning Theory differ from the behaviorist approach?",
      "options": [
        "It emphasizes cognitive processes",
        "It focuses solely on reinforcement",
        "It ignores observational learning",
        "It relies on classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Social Learning Theory differs from the behaviorist approach by emphasizing the role of cognitive processes in learning through observation. This corresponds to: It emphasizes cognitive processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Bandura's concept of reciprocal determinism suggest?",
      "options": [
        "Behavior is solely determined by genetics",
        "Behavior is influenced by the environment and personal choices",
        "Behavior is only learned through direct experience",
        "Behavior is fixed and unchangeable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Reciprocal determinism suggests that behavior is influenced by both the environment and the individual's choices, highlighting a dynamic interaction. This corresponds to: Behavior is influenced by the environment and personal choices."
