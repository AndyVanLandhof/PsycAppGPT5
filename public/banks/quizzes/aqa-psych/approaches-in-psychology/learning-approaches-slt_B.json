    {
      "question": "What is the primary concept of Bandura's Social Learning Theory as proposed in 1977?",
      "options": [
        "Learning through direct reinforcement",
        "Learning through observation and imitation",
        "Learning through classical conditioning",
        "Learning through operant conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bandura's Social Learning Theory emphasizes that individuals learn behaviors by observing and imitating others, rather than through direct reinforcement. This corresponds to: Learning through observation and imitation."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Bandura's 1961 study, what behavior did children imitate after observing a model?",
      "options": [
        "Aggressive behavior",
        "Cooperative behavior",
        "Fearful behavior",
        "Indifferent behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In Bandura's 1961 study, children imitated aggressive behavior after observing a model acting aggressively towards a Bobo doll"
    },
    {
      "question": "A child observes their parent showing affection by hugging and kissing. According to Social Learning Theory, what is this an example of?",
      "options": [
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Modelling",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates modelling, where the child learns affectionate behavior by observing and imitating their parent's actions"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a key feature of Bandura's Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "Reciprocal determinism",
        "Unconscious motives",
        "Biological predispositions",
        "Cognitive schemas"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Reciprocal determinism is a key feature of Bandura's Social Learning Theory, suggesting that behavior is influenced by personal factors, behavior, and the environment"
    },
    {
      "question": "In a study, children who watched a video of a model being rewarded for aggressive behavior were more likely to imitate that behavior. This is an example of what concept?",
      "options": [
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Identification",
        "Operant conditioning",
        "Cognitive dissonance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This scenario demonstrates vicarious reinforcement, where observing a model being rewarded influences the observer's likelihood of imitating the behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "What methodological issue is often associated with Bandura's research on Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "Lack of ecological validity",
        "Over-reliance on self-report measures",
        "Insufficient sample size",
        "Failure to control variables"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Bandura's studies, particularly the Bobo doll experiment, have been criticized for lacking ecological validity, as the artificial setting may not reflect real-life situations. This corresponds to: Lack of ecological validity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Social Learning Theory differ from the behaviorist approach?",
      "options": [
        "It emphasizes cognitive processes",
        "It ignores observational learning",
        "It focuses solely on reinforcement",
        "It denies the role of the environment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Social Learning Theory differs from the behaviorist approach by emphasizing the role of cognitive processes, such as attention and retention, in learning through observation. This corresponds to: It emphasizes cognitive processes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which term refers to the process of adopting the behaviors of a role model in Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "Identification",
        "Reinforcement",
        "Conditioning",
        "Schema"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Identification refers to the process in which individuals adopt the behaviors of a role model, a key aspect of Bandura's Social Learning Theory"
    },
    {
      "question": "A teenager begins to smoke after seeing their friends do so and receiving positive attention. This behavior can be explained by which aspect of Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "Direct reinforcement",
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Classical conditioning",
        "Operant conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This behavior can be explained by vicarious reinforcement, where the teenager learns that smoking is associated with positive social outcomes by observing their peers"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do mediational processes play in Bandura's Social Learning Theory?",
      "options": [
        "They determine the outcome of reinforcement",
        "They mediate between observation and imitation",
        "They are irrelevant to the learning process",
        "They are only applicable in classical conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mediational processes in Bandura's Social Learning Theory refer to the cognitive factors that influence whether a behavior is imitated after observation. This corresponds to: They mediate between observation and imitation."
