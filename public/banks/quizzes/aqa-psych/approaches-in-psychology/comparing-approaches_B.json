    {
      "question": "Which approach in psychology asserts that human beings have free will and operate as active agents in determining their own development?",
      "options": [
        "Biological",
        "Behaviourist",
        "Humanistic",
        "Cognitive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The humanistic approach emphasizes free will, contrasting with determinist perspectives"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the nature-nurture debate, what does the term 'environmental determinism' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "Genetic influences on behaviour",
        "Learned behaviours from the environment",
        "Unconscious drives influencing behaviour",
        "Biological predispositions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Environmental determinism suggests that behaviour is shaped by external influences, such as learning experiences. This corresponds to: Learned behaviours from the environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "A study found that identical twins had a concordance rate of 69% for reading ability. What does this suggest about the nature-nurture debate?",
      "options": [
        "Nature has no influence",
        "Nurture is the sole factor",
        "Both nature and nurture play a role",
        "Only environmental factors are significant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The 69% concordance rate indicates a strong genetic influence (nature) but also highlights the role of environmental factors (nurture). This corresponds to: Both nature and nurture play a role."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of determinism is associated with the belief that unconscious forces drive behaviour?",
      "options": [
        "Biological determinism",
        "Environmental determinism",
        "Psychic determinism",
        "Hard determinism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Psychic determinism is a key feature of the psychodynamic approach, emphasizing unconscious influences"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the cognitive approach view the concept of determinism?",
      "options": [
        "It supports hard determinism",
        "It rejects all forms of determinism",
        "It advocates soft determinism",
        "It aligns with biological determinism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The cognitive approach suggests that while we make choices, these are limited by our knowledge and experiences, thus supporting soft determinism. This corresponds to: It advocates soft determinism."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a scenario where a child learns aggressive behaviour from an older sibling, which type of determinism is primarily at play?",
      "options": [
        "Biological determinism",
        "Environmental determinism",
        "Psychic determinism",
        "Hard determinism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The child's aggressive behaviour is learned through environmental influences, illustrating environmental determinism"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key criticism of reductionist approaches in psychology?",
      "options": [
        "They ignore biological factors",
        "They oversimplify complex behaviours",
        "They focus too much on free will",
        "They lack empirical support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Reductionist approaches are often criticized for oversimplifying complex behaviours by breaking them down into basic components. This corresponds to: They oversimplify complex behaviours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which approach is most likely to emphasize the role of genetics in behaviour?",
      "options": [
        "Humanistic",
        "Behaviourist",
        "Biological",
        "Cognitive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The biological approach focuses on genetic influences and innate factors in determining behaviour"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the term 'holism' refer to in psychological approaches?",
      "options": [
        "Focusing on individual components of behaviour",
        "Considering the whole person and their context",
        "Emphasizing genetic factors only",
        "Rejecting all forms of determinism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Holism involves looking at the whole individual and their environment rather than isolating specific factors. This corresponds to: Considering the whole person and their context."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes 'reciprocal determinism' as proposed by Bandura?",
      "options": [
        "Behaviour is solely determined by genetics",
        "Behaviour is influenced by environmental factors and also influences the environment",
        "Behaviour is completely free and unconstrained",
        "Behaviour is determined by unconscious drives"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Reciprocal determinism suggests a two-way interaction between behaviour and environmental influences. This corresponds to: Behaviour is influenced by environmental factors and also influences the environment."
