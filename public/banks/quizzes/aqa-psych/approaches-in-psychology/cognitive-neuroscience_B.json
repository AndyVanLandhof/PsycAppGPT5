      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Tulving et al. demonstrated that episodic and semantic memories are processed in different areas of the prefrontal cortex"

      "question": "What is a potential limitation of drug therapy for coping with stress, as noted in the literature?",
      "options": [
        "It is ineffective for all patients",
        "It can lead to dependency",
        "It requires extensive training",
        "It is only suitable for short-term use"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Drug therapy can lead to dependency and has side effects, which limits its long-term effectiveness. This corresponds to: It can lead to dependency."
