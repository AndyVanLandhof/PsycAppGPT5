    {
      "question": "Which neurotransmitter has been linked to increased aggression according to Crockett et al. (2010)?",
      "options": [
        "Dopamine",
        "Serotonin",
        "Norepinephrine",
        "Acetylcholine"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Crockett et al. found that low levels of serotonin are associated with increased aggressive behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the biological approach, what does the term 'genotype' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The observable characteristics of an individual",
        "The genetic makeup of an individual",
        "The influence of the environment on behavior",
        "The interaction between genes and environment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Genotype refers to the actual genetic makeup of an individual, distinct from phenotype, which is how these genes are expressed. This corresponds to: The genetic makeup of an individual."
    },
    {
      "question": "A study found that identical twins raised apart showed differences in personality traits. This supports which aspect of the biological approach?",
      "options": [
        "The influence of environmental factors",
        "The importance of neurochemistry",
        "The role of genetic inheritance",
        "The significance of learned behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates that while genetics play a role, environmental factors also significantly influence the expression of personality traits. This corresponds to: The influence of environmental factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between genotype and phenotype?",
      "options": [
        "Genotype is influenced by environmental factors, while phenotype is fixed",
        "Genotype is the genetic code, while phenotype is the expression of that code",
        "Phenotype can only be observed in identical twins",
        "Genotype and phenotype are identical in all individuals"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Genotype is the genetic code inherited from parents, while phenotype is how that genetic code is expressed in observable traits. This corresponds to: Genotype is the genetic code, while phenotype is the expression of that code."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a limitation of the biological approach regarding human behavior?",
      "options": [
        "It ignores the role of genetics",
        "It is overly deterministic",
        "It does not consider neurochemistry",
        "It fails to account for evolutionary influences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach is criticized for being overly deterministic, suggesting behavior is solely governed by genetic factors without considering environmental influences. This corresponds to: It is overly deterministic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following studies supports the idea that genetic factors influence mate preferences?",
      "options": [
        "Bandura's Bobo Doll experiment",
        "Buss's study on human mate preferences",
        "Pavlov's classical conditioning research",
        "Skinner's operant conditioning experiments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Buss's study demonstrated universal similarities in mate preferences across cultures, suggesting a genetic basis for these behaviors. This corresponds to: Buss's study on human mate preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher is studying the impact of serotonin levels on mood disorders. This aligns with which aspect of the biological approach?",
      "options": [
        "The role of environmental factors",
        "The influence of neurochemistry",
        "The significance of learned behavior",
        "The importance of social learning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario highlights the biological approach's focus on neurochemistry, specifically how neurotransmitter levels can affect behavior and mood. This corresponds to: The influence of neurochemistry."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the biological approach suggest about the expression of an individual's genotype?",
      "options": [
        "It is solely determined by genetic factors",
        "It is influenced by environmental interactions",
        "It remains constant throughout life",
        "It is irrelevant to psychological functioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach posits that while genotype is inherited, phenotype—the expression of genotype—is significantly influenced by environmental factors. This corresponds to: It is influenced by environmental interactions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes Biological approach (genetics, neurochemistry, genotype/phenotype)?",
      "options": [
        "Conditioning",
        "Schema",
        "Evolution",
        "Reinforcement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The biological approach incorporates evolutionary concepts to explain behaviors that may have adaptive significance, such as aggression and mate selection"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the biological approach differ from the behaviorist approach regarding the nature vs. nurture debate?",
      "options": [
        "Both approaches emphasize genetic factors equally",
        "The biological approach focuses on genetics, while behaviorism emphasizes learning",
        "Both approaches ignore environmental influences",
        "The biological approach is more deterministic than behaviorism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The biological approach argues that behavior is primarily influenced by genetic inheritance, while behaviorism posits that behavior is learned through environmental interactions. This corresponds to: The biological approach focuses on genetics, while behaviorism emphasizes learning."
