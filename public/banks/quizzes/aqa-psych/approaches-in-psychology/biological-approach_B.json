    {
      "question": "Which neurotransmitter has been linked to increased aggression when found at low levels, according to Crockett et al. (2010)?",
      "options": [
        "Dopamine",
        "Serotonin",
        "Norepinephrine",
        "Acetylcholine"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Crockett et al. (2010) found that low levels of serotonin are associated with increased aggressive behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the biological approach, what does the term 'genotype' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The observable characteristics of an individual",
        "The genetic makeup of an individual",
        "The influence of the environment on behavior",
        "The interaction between genes and environment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Genotype refers to the actual genetic makeup of an individual, as opposed to phenotype, which is the expression of those genes. This corresponds to: The genetic makeup of an individual."
    },
    {
      "question": "A study found that identical twins raised apart still showed similarities in personality traits. This supports which aspect of the biological approach?",
      "options": [
        "The role of environmental factors",
        "The influence of neurochemistry",
        "The genetic basis of behavior",
        "The impact of learning experiences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The similarities in personality traits among identical twins raised apart suggest a strong genetic influence on behavior. This corresponds to: The genetic basis of behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary focus of cognitive neuroscience within the biological approach?",
      "options": [
        "The study of learned behaviors",
        "The interaction between cognitive processes and biological systems",
        "The role of unconscious drives",
        "The influence of social factors on behavior"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Cognitive neuroscience focuses on how cognitive processes are linked to biological systems, particularly brain functions. This corresponds to: The interaction between cognitive processes and biological systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between genotype and phenotype?",
      "options": [
        "Genotype is influenced by environmental factors, while phenotype is not",
        "Genotype is the genetic makeup, while phenotype is how these genes are expressed",
        "Phenotype is inherited, while genotype is acquired",
        "There is no relationship between genotype and phenotype"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Genotype is the genetic makeup of an individual, while phenotype refers to the expression of those genes through observable traits. This corresponds to: Genotype is the genetic makeup, while phenotype is how these genes are expressed."
    },
    {
      "question": "A researcher finds that a specific gene variant is more common in individuals with depression. This finding suggests what about the biological approach?",
      "options": [
        "It emphasizes the role of environmental factors",
        "It supports the idea of a genetic basis for behavior",
        "It ignores the influence of learning",
        "It is deterministic in nature"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The association of a gene variant with depression supports the biological approach's emphasis on a genetic basis for behavior. This corresponds to: It supports the idea of a genetic basis for behavior."
    },
    {
      "question": "One limitation of the biological approach is that it is often considered deterministic. What does this mean?",
      "options": [
        "It suggests behavior is solely influenced by environmental factors",
        "It implies that behavior is governed by genetic factors beyond individual control",
        "It denies the role of cognitive processes",
        "It overlooks the importance of social influences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Determinism in the biological approach means that it views behavior as being controlled by genetic factors, which can overlook the role of environmental influences. This corresponds to: It implies that behavior is governed by genetic factors beyond individual control."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Buss's study on mate preferences, what does the finding of universal similarities across cultures suggest?",
      "options": [
        "Cultural factors are the primary influence on mate selection",
        "Genetic factors may play a role in mate preferences",
        "Learning experiences shape mate preferences",
        "Individual differences are more significant than genetic similarities"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The universal similarities in mate preferences across cultures suggest that genetic factors may influence these behaviors. This corresponds to: Genetic factors may play a role in mate preferences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key criticism of the biological approach regarding its explanation of behavior?",
      "options": [
        "It overemphasizes the role of cognitive processes",
        "It ignores the influence of genetics",
        "It can be too simplistic by not considering environmental factors",
        "It fails to provide empirical evidence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A key criticism is that the biological approach can be overly simplistic, as it often neglects the mediating effects of environmental influences on behavior. This corresponds to: It can be too simplistic by not considering environmental factors."
