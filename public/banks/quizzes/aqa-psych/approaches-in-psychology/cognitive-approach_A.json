    {
      "question": "What does the information processing approach suggest about cognitive processes?",
      "options": [
        "They occur randomly",
        "They flow through a sequence of stages",
        "They are solely influenced by emotions",
        "They are identical to computer processes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The information processing approach suggests that cognitive processes flow through a sequence of stages, including input, storage, and retrieval. This corresponds to: They flow through a sequence of stages."

      "question": "In Baddeley and Hitch's working memory model, which component was added in 2000?",
      "options": [
        "Phonological loop",
        "Episodic buffer",
        "Visuospatial sketchpad",
        "Central executive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The episodic buffer was added to Baddeley and Hitch's working memory model in 2000 to integrate information from different sources"

      "question": "A researcher is studying how children imitate behaviors seen in media. Which cognitive concept is most relevant to this study?",
      "options": [
        "Schemas",
        "Vicarious reinforcement",
        "Cognitive dissonance",
        "Operant conditioning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Vicarious reinforcement is relevant as it explains how children learn behaviors by observing the consequences of others' actions"

      "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of using computer models to explain human cognition?",
      "options": [
        "They accurately reflect human memory",
        "They do not account for emotional influences",
        "They are based on observable behavior",
        "They are easy to understand"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Computer models do not account for emotional influences, which are significant in human cognition but irrelevant to computers. This corresponds to: They do not account for emotional influences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do schemas play in cognitive processing?",
      "options": [
        "They are fixed responses to stimuli",
        "They help organize and interpret information",
        "They are irrelevant to memory",
        "They only apply to visual information"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Schemas help individuals organize and interpret information, influencing how they perceive and respond to new experiences. This corresponds to: They help organize and interpret information."

      "question": "A study finds that children exposed to aggressive models in media are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior. This supports which cognitive theory?",

        "Cognitive dissonance",
        "Social learning theory",
        "Behaviorism",
        "Humanistic psychology"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This finding supports social learning theory, which posits that behavior is learned through observation and imitation of models"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a key difference between human and computer information processing?",
      "options": [
        "Humans process information faster",
        "Computers do not forget information",
        "Humans can store unlimited information",
        "Computers are influenced by emotions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A key difference is that computers do not forget information, while humans can forget or make mistakes in their processing"

        "They provide concrete evidence",
        "They simplify complex processes for understanding",
        "They eliminate the need for research",
        "They are always accurate representations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Theoretical models simplify complex cognitive processes, making them easier to understand and study. This corresponds to: They simplify complex processes for understanding."
