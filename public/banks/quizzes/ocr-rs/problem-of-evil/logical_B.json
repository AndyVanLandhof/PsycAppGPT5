    {
      "question": "What does the inconsistent triad in the logical problem of evil consist of?",
      "options": [
        "Omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and the existence of evil",
        "Omniscience, omnipotence, and moral evil",
        "Omnipotence, free will, and natural evil",
        "Omnibenevolence, original sin, and suffering"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The inconsistent triad highlights the conflict between God's attributes of being all-powerful and all-good while evil exists. This corresponds to: Omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and the existence of evil."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Epicurus, how does the existence of evil challenge the nature of God?",
      "options": [
        "It shows God is not omniscient",
        "It suggests God is not omnipotent",
        "It implies God is not benevolent",
        "It indicates God is indifferent to suffering"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Epicurus argued that if God is all-powerful, He should be able to prevent evil, thus questioning His omnipotence. This corresponds to: It suggests God is not omnipotent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a potential solution to the logical problem of evil proposed by process theology?",
      "options": [
        "God is not omnibenevolent",
        "God is not omnipotent",
        "Evil is an illusion",
        "Evil is a necessary part of creation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Process theology suggests that God may not be omnipotent and thus cannot control all evil or human choices. This corresponds to: God is not omnipotent."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the logical problem of evil, what does Augustine argue about the nature of evil?",
      "options": [
        "Evil is a substance created by God",
        "Evil is a privation of good",
        "Evil is necessary for free will",
        "Evil is an illusion that does not exist"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Augustine posits that evil is not a created entity but rather a lack of good, which absolves God from creating it. This corresponds to: Evil is a privation of good."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Hick's reworking of the Irenaean theodicy address the existence of natural evil?",
      "options": [
        "It denies the existence of natural evil",
        "It suggests natural evil is a punishment from God",
        "It proposes natural evil serves a purpose in soul-making",
        "It argues natural evil is a result of human free will"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hick's view is that natural evil contributes to human development and the process of becoming more like God. This corresponds to: It proposes natural evil serves a purpose in soul-making."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a believer argues that suffering is necessary for spiritual growth, which aspect of the problem of evil are they addressing?",
      "options": [
        "Logical problem of evil",
        "Evidential problem of evil",
        "Moral evil",
        "Natural evil"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This argument addresses the logical problem of evil by suggesting that suffering has a purpose in developing faith"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with the evidential problem of evil?",
      "options": [
        "It assumes we fully understand God's nature",
        "It relies solely on historical examples",
        "It ignores the role of free will",
        "It does not consider the existence of good"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The evidential problem of evil assumes a complete understanding of God, which may not be possible for believers. This corresponds to: It assumes we fully understand God's nature."
    },
    {

      "options": [
        "It focuses on the logical inconsistency of God's attributes",
        "It argues that the amount of evil observed contradicts the existence of an all-good God",
        "It suggests that evil is necessary for free will",
        "It claims that evil is an illusion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The evidential problem of evil posits that the observable presence of evil in the world challenges the belief in an all-good God. This corresponds to: It argues that the amount of evil observed contradicts the existence of an all-good God."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of epistemic distance relate to the problem of evil?",
      "options": [
        "It suggests that humans are too far from God to understand His decisions",
        "It argues that God is indifferent to human suffering",
        "It implies that evil is necessary for human development",
        "It denies the existence of evil altogether"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Epistemic distance refers to the idea that humans may not fully comprehend God's reasons for allowing evil. This corresponds to: It suggests that humans are too far from God to understand His decisions."
