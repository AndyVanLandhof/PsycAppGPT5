    {
      "question": "What are the three elements of the inconsistent triad in the logical problem of evil?",
      "options": [
        "Omnipotence, omnibenevolence, evil exists",
        "Omnipotence, omniscience, moral evil",
        "Omnibenevolence, free will, natural evil",
        "Evil, suffering, divine justice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The inconsistent triad consists of the attributes of God (omnipotence and omnibenevolence) and the existence of evil. This corresponds to: Omnipotence, omnibenevolence, evil exists."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the logical problem of evil, which of the following statements is true if God is omnipotent?",
      "options": [
        "God cannot prevent evil",
        "Evil does not exist",
        "God must not be wholly good",
        "God is not omniscient"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "If God is omnipotent and evil exists, it implies that God cannot be wholly good or does not care enough to prevent evil. This corresponds to: God must not be wholly good."
    },
    {
      "question": "Epicurus presented a challenge to theistic beliefs by questioning how God can be both all-powerful and all-loving while evil exists. What does this illustrate?",

        "The evidential problem of evil",
        "The inconsistent triad",
        "Theodicy",
        "Moral relativism"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Epicurus's challenge illustrates the inconsistent triad, highlighting the contradiction between divine attributes and the presence of evil"

        "Irenaean theodicy",
        "Process theology",
        "Deistic perspective"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The concept of soul-making is associated with Irenaean theodicy, which suggests that suffering has a purpose in human development"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the logical problem of evil, what does the term 'privatio boni' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "Evil as a substance",
        "Evil as a lack of good",
        "Evil as a necessary condition",
        "Evil as a divine test"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "'Privatio boni' refers to the idea that evil is not a substance but rather a lack of goodness, as proposed by Augustine. This corresponds to: Evil as a lack of good."

    {
      "question": "A student argues that the existence of natural disasters challenges the belief in an all-loving God. This scenario illustrates which aspect of the problem of evil?",

        "Evidential problem of evil",
        "Theodicy",
        "Moral evil"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario illustrates the evidential problem of evil, as it presents evidence of suffering that challenges the belief in an all-loving God"
    },
    {
      "question": "A critique of Augustine's theodicy is that it may not adequately address the existence of which type of evil?",

        "Metaphysical evil",
        "Social evil"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that Augustine's theodicy does not sufficiently account for natural evil, which is not a direct result of human actions"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does process theology differ from traditional views regarding God's omnipotence in relation to evil?",
      "options": [
        "It denies God's existence",
        "It suggests God cannot control evil",
        "It claims God is indifferent to evil",
        "It argues God is all-powerful"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Process theology posits that God is not omnipotent in the traditional sense and cannot control evil or human free choices. This corresponds to: It suggests God cannot control evil."

      "options": [
        "Epicurus",
        "Augustine",
        "Hick",
        "Irenaeus"
      ],

      "explanation": "Hick argues that our understanding of love may need to be redefined, suggesting that suffering can have a developmental purpose"
    },
    {
      "question": "The evidential problem of evil argues that the observation of evil is sufficient to argue against the existence of God. What is a potential issue with this argument?",
      "options": [
        "It assumes complete knowledge of God",
        "It relies solely on emotional responses",
        "It overlooks historical context",
        "It is based on anecdotal evidence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The evidential problem of evil assumes that we fully understand God's nature and decision-making, which may not be the case. This corresponds to: It assumes complete knowledge of God."
