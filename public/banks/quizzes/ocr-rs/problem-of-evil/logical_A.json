  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What are the three elements of the inconsistent triad in the logical problem of evil?",
      "options": [
        "Omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and evil exists",
        "Omnipotence, omniscience, and suffering",
        "Omnibenevolence, free will, and evil",
        "Evil, suffering, and divine justice"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The inconsistent triad highlights the conflict between the existence of an all-powerful, all-good God and the presence of evil. This corresponds to: Omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and evil exists."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the logical problem of evil, which attribute of God is questioned when evil exists?",
      "options": [
        "Omnipotence",
        "Omniscience",
        "Omnibenevolence",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The logical problem of evil challenges the compatibility of God's omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and the existence of evil. This corresponds to: All of the above."
    },
    {
      "question": "If God is omnipotent but does not prevent evil, what conclusion can be drawn according to the inconsistent triad?",
      "options": [
        "God is not benevolent",
        "Evil does not exist",
        "God is not omnipotent",
        "God is indifferent to suffering"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "If God is all-powerful yet allows evil, it suggests that God may not be wholly good or benevolent. This corresponds to: God is not benevolent."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the logical problem of evil, what does process theology suggest?",
      "options": [
        "God is not omnipotent",
        "Evil is an illusion",
        "Humans have no free will",
        "God is indifferent to evil"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Process theology posits that God may not be omnipotent and thus cannot control all evil or human choices. This corresponds to: God is not omnipotent."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Augustine argue about the nature of evil?",
      "options": [
        "Evil is a substance created by God",
        "Evil is a privation of good",
        "Evil is necessary for free will",
        "Evil is an illusion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Augustine claims that evil is not a created substance but rather a lack of good, which helps absolve God from blame. This corresponds to: Evil is a privation of good."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Hick's reworking of the Irenaean theodicy address the problem of evil?",
      "options": [
        "It denies the existence of evil",
        "It suggests evil is necessary for soul-making",
        "It argues God is not omnipotent",
        "It claims evil is a punishment for sin"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hick's theodicy proposes that natural evil serves a purpose in developing human beings towards divine likeness. This corresponds to: It suggests evil is necessary for soul-making."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential criticism of the logical problem of evil regarding human free will?",
      "options": [
        "It assumes humans cannot choose evil",
        "It overlooks the role of divine justice",
        "It assumes God's power is absolute",
        "It ignores the existence of natural evil"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The logical problem of evil assumes that God's omnipotence means He can prevent all evil, which may not account for human free will. This corresponds to: It assumes God's power is absolute."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the evidential problem of evil argue?",
      "options": [
        "Evil is necessary for free will",
        "Evil's existence contradicts God's attributes",
        "Evil is a privation of good",
        "Evil is an illusion created by humans"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The evidential problem of evil suggests that the observable presence of evil in the world is sufficient evidence against the existence of an all-good, all-powerful God. This corresponds to: Evil's existence contradicts God's attributes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which philosopher first articulated the logical problem of evil?",
      "options": [
        "Augustine",
        "Hick",
        "Epicurus",
        "Irenaeus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Epicurus is credited with formulating the logical problem of evil, questioning how an all-powerful, all-good God can coexist with evil"

        "Evil does not exist",
        "God is indifferent to suffering"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'vale of soul-making' suggests that the existence of evil and suffering is essential for human development and spiritual growth. This corresponds to: Suffering is necessary for spiritual growth."
