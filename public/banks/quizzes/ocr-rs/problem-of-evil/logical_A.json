    {
      "question": "What does the inconsistent triad in the logical problem of evil consist of?",
      "options": [
        "Omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and evil exists",
        "Omnipotence, omniscience, and free will",
        "Evil exists, free will, and divine justice",
        "Omnipotence, divine justice, and moral evil"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The inconsistent triad highlights the contradiction between the existence of an all-powerful, all-good God and the presence of evil. This corresponds to: Omnipotence, omnibenevolence, and evil exists."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to process theology, how might the problem of evil be resolved?",
      "options": [
        "God is not omnipotent and cannot control evil",
        "Evil is an illusion",
        "God is both powerful and good",
        "Evil is necessary for human development"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Process theology suggests that God may not be omnipotent and thus cannot prevent evil, addressing the logical problem of evil. This corresponds to: God is not omnipotent and cannot control evil."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the logical problem of evil, what does Augustine argue about the nature of evil?",

        "Evil is a substance created by God",
        "Evil is a privation of good",
        "Evil is necessary for free will",
        "Evil does not exist"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Augustine posits that evil is not a substance but a lack of good, which helps to absolve God from the blame for evil. This corresponds to: Evil is a privation of good."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a believer argues that suffering is necessary for spiritual growth, which aspect of the problem of evil are they addressing?",

        "Moral evil",
        "Natural evil"

      "options": [
        "It questions the logical consistency of God's attributes",

        "It suggests that evil is necessary for free will",
        "It denies the existence of evil altogether"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The evidential problem of evil focuses on the observable evidence of evil in the world as a challenge to the existence of an all-good God. This corresponds to: It argues that the amount of evil observed is incompatible with an all-good God."

    {
      "question": "How does Hick's reworking of the Irenaean theodicy address the problem of evil?",

        "By denying the existence of evil",
        "By suggesting evil is necessary for human development",
        "By claiming God is not omnipotent",
        "By stating that evil is a privation of good"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hick argues that natural evil serves a purpose in enabling humans to develop towards divine likeness, addressing the problem of evil. This corresponds to: By suggesting evil is necessary for human development."
    },
    {

      "options": [

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
