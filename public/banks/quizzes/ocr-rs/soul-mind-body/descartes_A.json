      "options": [
        "The mind is divisible like the body.",
        "The mind can be doubted, but the existence of the 'I' cannot.",
        "The body is immaterial and cannot think.",
        "The mind and body are identical substances."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Descartes argues that while one can doubt the existence of the body, the existence of the thinking 'I' is undeniable, supporting his view of dualism. This corresponds to: The mind can be doubted, but the existence of the 'I' cannot.."
    },
    {

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Descartes employs Leibniz's Law, which states that if two objects are identical, they must share all properties; thus, differences imply distinct substances"

        "It is overly complex."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Ryle argues that Descartes' view of the mind as a separate entity is a category error, misunderstanding how we describe mental processes. This corresponds to: It is a category error.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What example does Ryle use to illustrate a category error in Descartes' dualism?",
      "options": [

        "The soul is essential for consciousness."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
