      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Plato is described as a dualist, arguing that the soul is a separate and essential part of us that can reason, unlike the impermanent body. This corresponds to: The soul is separate from the body.."

    {
      "question": "A student argues that Plato's view of the soul is outdated because it relies on metaphysical concepts. Which aspect of Plato's theory is being critiqued?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Plato uses the argument from knowledge to assert that the soul has innate knowledge, which it recollects from its time in the World of the Forms. This corresponds to: It demonstrates that the soul has innate knowledge from the World of the Forms.."

      ],
