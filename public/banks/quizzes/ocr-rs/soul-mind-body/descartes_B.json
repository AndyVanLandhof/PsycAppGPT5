    {
      "question": "What is the main argument Descartes uses to support his substance dualism regarding the mind and body?",
      "options": [
        "The mind is divisible like the body",
        "The mind can be doubted while the existence of the 'I' cannot",
        "The body is immaterial",
        "The mind is a physical entity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Descartes argues that while the body can be doubted, the existence of the thinking 'I' cannot, supporting his view that the mind is a separate substance. This corresponds to: The mind can be doubted while the existence of the 'I' cannot."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Descartes, where does the interaction between the mind and body occur?",
      "options": [
        "In the cerebral cortex",
        "In the pineal gland",
        "In the spinal cord",
        "In the hypothalamus"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Descartes believed that the pineal gland was the point of interaction between the immaterial mind and the physical body. This corresponds to: In the pineal gland."

      "options": [
        "I think, therefore I am",
        "I feel, therefore I exist",
        "I see, therefore I know",
        "I act, therefore I am"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This phrase encapsulates Descartes' assertion that the act of thinking is proof of one's existence. This corresponds to: I think, therefore I am."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of Descartes' dualism, what does the term 'divisibility' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "The mind can be divided into parts",
        "The body can be divided into parts",
        "The soul is indivisible",
        "The mind and body are identical"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Descartes argues that the body is divisible, while the mind is indivisible, supporting the idea that they are different substances. This corresponds to: The body can be divided into parts."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of 'qualia' challenge Descartes' dualism?",
      "options": [
        "It supports the idea of a non-physical mind",
        "It suggests consciousness can be fully explained by neuroscience",
        "It highlights the first-person nature of conscious experience",
        "It denies the existence of the body"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Qualia emphasize that conscious experiences are subjective and cannot be fully captured by third-person scientific explanations. This corresponds to: It highlights the first-person nature of conscious experience."

      "question": "What is a key criticism of Descartes' dualism related to the interaction problem?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks empirical support",
        "It assumes the mind is physical",
        "It suggests the mind and body are identical",
        "It fails to explain how a non-physical mind interacts with a physical body"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that if the mind is non-physical, it is unclear how it can influence physical actions in the body. This corresponds to: It fails to explain how a non-physical mind interacts with a physical body."
    },
    {
      "question": "Gilbert Ryle's critique of Descartes' dualism is primarily based on which concept?",
      "options": [
        "The existence of the soul",
        "The problem of interaction",
        "Category error",
        "Neuroscience"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,

        "The complexity of the brain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ryle suggests that Descartes misuses language, leading to confusion about the nature of the mind and body. This corresponds to: The ambiguity of language."

      "options": [
        "Ockham's Razor",
        "Leibniz's Law",
        "Cogito, ergo sum",
        "The principle of sufficient reason"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
