      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Plato is described as a dualist, arguing that the soul is a separate and essential part of us that can reason, unlike the impermanent body. This corresponds to: The soul is separate from the body."

        "By stating that knowledge is learned through experience",
        "By suggesting that the soul recalls knowledge from the World of the Forms",
        "By claiming that the body is the source of all knowledge",
        "By arguing that the soul does not exist before birth"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

        "The soul has no influence on the body"
      ],
