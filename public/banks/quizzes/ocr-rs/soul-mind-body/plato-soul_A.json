      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

        "By claiming that the soul does not exist"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

        "It is too simplistic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that Plato's dualism lacks empirical verification, making it difficult to substantiate the existence of the soul separate from the body. This corresponds to: It lacks empirical verification of the soul's existence."
