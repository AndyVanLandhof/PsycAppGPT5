  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "According to Swinburne, how does omniscience relate to God's knowledge of future events?",
      "options": [
        "God knows all future events as they are predetermined.",
        "God knows all future events that are predictable by physical laws.",
        "God does not know any future events.",
        "God knows future events but cannot intervene."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Swinburne suggests that God's knowledge may include all future events that are predictable by physical laws, but does not extend to free decisions made by humans. This corresponds to: God knows all future events that are predictable by physical laws.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Boethius' view on God's knowledge of future events?",
      "options": [
        "God knows the future through conditional necessity.",
        "God has no knowledge of the future.",
        "God's knowledge of the future is limited to what is logically possible.",
        "God knows the future because it is fixed."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Boethius argues that God sees everything in a simultaneous present and knows future events through conditional necessity, preserving human free will. This corresponds to: God knows the future through conditional necessity.."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of a timeless God conflict with the traditional view of God in classical theism?",
      "options": [
        "It suggests God cannot know the past.",
        "It implies God cannot interact with creation.",
        "It denies God's omnipotence.",
        "It limits God's benevolence."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A timeless God, as proposed by Boethius, raises issues regarding God's ability to interact with creation, which is a key aspect of classical theism. This corresponds to: It implies God cannot interact with creation.."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of omniscience, what does the term 'middle knowledge' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "God's knowledge of all past events only.",
        "God's knowledge of all future events only.",
        "God's knowledge of what could have happened under different circumstances.",
        "God's knowledge of all logical possibilities."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Middle knowledge is the view that God knows not only everything that happens but also everything that might have happened if different choices had been made. This corresponds to: God's knowledge of what could have happened under different circumstances.."
    },
    {
      "question": "If God's omniscience includes knowing all future events, what philosophical problem does this raise regarding human free will?",
      "options": [
        "It suggests humans have no free will.",
        "It implies God's knowledge is limited.",
        "It indicates God cannot intervene in human affairs.",
        "It shows that God is not benevolent."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "If God knows all future events, it raises the question of whether humans can truly have free will, as their choices may seem predetermined. This corresponds to: It suggests humans have no free will.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Swinburne's view of God's omniscience allows for what aspect of human experience?",
      "options": [
        "The inevitability of human choices.",
        "The unpredictability of human decisions.",
        "The fixed nature of future events.",
        "The absence of divine intervention."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Swinburne's perspective allows for human free choices, suggesting that while God knows the past and present, the future remains open to human decisions. This corresponds to: The unpredictability of human decisions.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key criticism of Boethius' view on God's knowledge and free will?",
      "options": [
        "It does not account for God's benevolence.",
        "It sacrifices God's immanence.",
        "It limits God's omnipotence.",
        "It denies the existence of free will."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

      "question": "How does Lady Philosophy's argument regarding God's eternity resolve the conflict between omniscience and free will?",
      "options": [
        "By suggesting God is timeless and cannot know the future.",
        "By proposing that God's knowledge is limited to the present.",
        "By asserting that God's eternity is a simultaneous possession of infinite life.",
        "By claiming that God does not intervene in time."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Lady Philosophy argues that God's eternity as a simultaneous possession of infinite life allows for both omniscience and human free will to coexist. This corresponds to: By asserting that God's eternity is a simultaneous possession of infinite life.."

    {
      "question": "What methodological issue arises when discussing God's omniscience and human free will?",
      "options": [
        "The lack of empirical evidence for God's existence.",
