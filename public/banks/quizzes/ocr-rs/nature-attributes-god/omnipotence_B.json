    {
      "question": "According to Aquinas, what does God's omnipotence entail?",
      "options": [
        "God can do anything, including the logically impossible",
        "God can only do what is logically possible",
        "God can change the past",
        "God can lie if he chooses to"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Aquinas argues that God's omnipotence is limited to actions that are logically possible. This corresponds to: God can only do what is logically possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Descartes' view on God's omnipotence?",
      "options": [
        "God cannot do the logically impossible",
        "God's omnipotence is limited by human free will",
        "God can do anything, even the logically impossible",
        "God's power is restricted by moral laws"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Descartes believes that God's omnipotence includes the ability to perform logically impossible actions. This corresponds to: God can do anything, even the logically impossible."
    },
    {
      "question": "If God is omnipotent, why does evil exist according to the problem of evil?",
      "options": [
        "God is not benevolent",
        "God cannot control human choices",
        "Evil does not exist",
        "God is not omnipotent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The problem of evil raises questions about God's omnipotence and whether He can control human free will. This corresponds to: God cannot control human choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Swinburne argue about the nature of God's omnipotence?",
      "options": [
        "It is absolute and without limitations",
        "It is limited by logical possibility",
        "It is dependent on human actions",
        "It is a matter of faith"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Swinburne posits that God's omnipotence is constrained by what is logically possible. This corresponds to: It is limited by logical possibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of omnipotence conflict with God's benevolence?",
      "options": [
        "God's power is limited by human understanding",
        "If God is all-loving, He should prevent evil",
        "God's omnipotence is a matter of interpretation",
        "God cannot be both omnipotent and omniscient"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The conflict arises because if God is all-loving, it raises the question of why He does not prevent evil. This corresponds to: If God is all-loving, He should prevent evil."
    },

        "God's power is limited to moral actions",
        "God's power is a matter of human perception"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "'Pantokrator' translates to 'Almighty', suggesting that God's power encompasses all things. This corresponds to: God has power over everything."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential issue with defining God's omnipotence as the ability to do everything?",

        "It implies God can lie",
        "It raises questions about the existence of evil",
        "It limits God's power to human understanding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Defining omnipotence as the ability to do everything leads to logical contradictions, such as whether God can change the past. This corresponds to: It suggests God can change the past."
    },

      "question": "What does the problem of evil suggest about the nature of God?",
      "options": [

      "options": [
        "It makes miracles more believable",
        "It contradicts the nature of God",
        "It suggests miracles are not truly miraculous",
        "It supports the idea of God's omnipotence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "If God can do the logically impossible, it supports the belief that He can perform miracles. This corresponds to: It supports the idea of God's omnipotence."
