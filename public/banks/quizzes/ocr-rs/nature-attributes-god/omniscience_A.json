  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "According to Swinburne, what does omniscience entail regarding God's knowledge of the future?",
      "options": [
        "God knows everything that will happen",
        "God knows everything that is logically possible to know",
        "God knows only the past",
        "God knows nothing about the future"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Swinburne defines omniscience as knowing everything that it is logically possible to know, which includes predictable future events but not free human decisions. This corresponds to: God knows everything that is logically possible to know."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Boethius' view of God's knowledge resolve the conflict between divine foreknowledge and human free will?",
      "options": [
        "By suggesting God knows the future by simple necessity",
        "By claiming God does not know the future",
        "By stating God knows the future through conditional necessity",
        "By denying human free will altogether"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Boethius argues that God knows human choices by conditional necessity, allowing for free will while maintaining divine foreknowledge. This corresponds to: By stating God knows the future through conditional necessity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key criticism of Boethius' view of God's eternity?",
      "options": [
        "It allows for human free will",
        "It suggests God cannot interact with creation",
        "It denies God's omniscience",
        "It conflicts with the concept of divine benevolence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that Boethius' timeless God cannot interact with creation, answer prayers, or form relationships with humans. This corresponds to: It suggests God cannot interact with creation."
    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Swinburne's model of God differ from Boethius' regarding omniscience?",
      "options": [
        "Swinburne denies God's omniscience",
        "Swinburne allows for God's free choices",
        "Swinburne believes God is timeless",
        "Swinburne argues God cannot know the past"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Swinburne's view allows for God's free choices, suggesting that God's omniscience does not negate human free will. This corresponds to: Swinburne allows for God's free choices."
    },
    {
      "question": "If God's omniscience is limited, what implication does this have for classical theism?",
      "options": [
        "It supports the idea of a timeless God",
        "It contradicts the nature of God as traditionally understood",
        "It enhances the concept of divine benevolence",
        "It affirms human free will"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A limited omniscience would conflict with the classical theistic view of God, who is traditionally understood to be all-knowing. This corresponds to: It contradicts the nature of God as traditionally understood."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a philosopher argues that God's knowledge is like that of a chess Grand Master, what aspect of God's knowledge are they emphasizing?",
      "options": [
        "God's omnipotence",
        "God's ability to predict human actions",
        "God's timelessness",
        "God's benevolence"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This analogy emphasizes God's ability to predict human actions while allowing for human free will, similar to how a Grand Master anticipates a novice's moves"
    },
    {
      "question": "In evaluating the conflict between omniscience and free will, what does Lady Philosophy suggest about God's eternity?",
      "options": [
        "It is a linear progression of time",
        "It is a simultaneous possession of infinite life",
        "It is irrelevant to human choices",
        "It denies God's interaction with time"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Lady Philosophy argues that God's eternity is a simultaneous possession of infinite life, which helps resolve the conflict between omniscience and free will. This corresponds to: It is a simultaneous possession of infinite life."

    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue raised by the discussion of divine attributes?",
      "options": [
        "The lack of empirical evidence for God's existence",
        "The inconsistency in definitions of omniscience",
        "The subjective interpretation of philosophical arguments",
        "The reliance on historical texts"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The discussion often lacks empirical evidence, making it difficult to substantiate claims about God's attributes. This corresponds to: The lack of empirical evidence for God's existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the concept of middle knowledge relate to God's omniscience?",
      "options": [
        "It suggests God knows only the past",
        "It implies God knows all possible outcomes of human choices",
        "It denies God's ability to know the future",
        "It supports the idea of a timeless God"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Middle knowledge posits that God knows not only what happens but also what could happen based on human choices, expanding the understanding of omniscience. This corresponds to: It implies God knows all possible outcomes of human choices."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The diamond analogy illustrates that God's attributes can be examined from different angles, providing a multifaceted understanding of divinity. This corresponds to: God can be understood from multiple perspectives."
