    {
      "question": "According to Boethius, how does God's knowledge differ from human knowledge?",
      "options": [
        "God's knowledge is based on time",
        "God's knowledge is limited",
        "God's knowledge is timeless and sees all events as a simultaneous present",
        "God's knowledge is subjective"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Boethius argues that God's knowledge is timeless and views all of time at once, unlike human knowledge which is confined to a temporal sequence. This corresponds to: God's knowledge is timeless and sees all events as a simultaneous present."

        "God's knowledge is based on historical events"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Conditional necessity refers to God's knowledge of events that depend on human choices, meaning God knows what will happen because of the choices made. This corresponds to: God knows future events based on human choices."

        "It is coherent and logical",
        "It is incoherent for God to know everything as a simultaneous present",
        "It supports the idea of free will",
        "It aligns with scientific understanding of time"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Kenny critiques Boethius by stating that the idea of God knowing everything in a simultaneous present is incoherent. This corresponds to: It is incoherent for God to know everything as a simultaneous present."

        "The acceptance of all religious claims as equally valid",
        "The rejection of empirical evidence in religious discourse"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,

        "It relies too heavily on empirical evidence",
        "It does not account for human free will",
        "It assumes a linear understanding of time",
        "It lacks a personal relationship with God"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A significant critique is that Boethius' view does not adequately address the implications of human free will in relation to God's omniscience. This corresponds to: It does not account for human free will."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Schleiermacher suggests that while God knows us intimately and can predict our actions, this does not negate our freedom to choose differently. This corresponds to: God knows us well enough to predict our actions, yet we remain free."
