      "question": "What does Wittgenstein mean by 'language games'?",

        "They are fixed rules for language use.",
        "They are contexts in which language is used meaningfully.",
        "They are games played by children to learn language.",
        "They are universal rules applicable to all languages."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Wittgenstein argues that language operates within specific contexts or 'games' where meaning is derived from the rules agreed upon by participants. This corresponds to: They are contexts in which language is used meaningfully.."

    {
      "question": "According to Wittgenstein, how does the concept of 'lebensform' relate to language?",
      "options": [
        "It refers to the biological basis of language.",
        "It indicates that language is a form of life shaped by social practices.",
        "It suggests that language is purely cognitive.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Wittgenstein describes 'lebensform' as the way language is intertwined with the forms of life and social practices of its users. This corresponds to: It indicates that language is a form of life shaped by social practices.."

      "options": [
        "It asserts that all religious statements are meaningless.",
        "It shows that religious language is only meaningful within its own context.",
        "It provides empirical evidence for religious claims.",
        "It denies the existence of God."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Wittgenstein's language games suggest that religious statements gain meaning from the context in which they are used, countering the Logical Positivist view that they are meaningless. This corresponds to: It shows that religious language is only meaningful within its own context.."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key criticism of Wittgenstein's language games from a religious perspective?",

        "They provide too much objective meaning to religious statements.",
        "They remove objective meaning from religious statements.",
        "They validate all forms of religious language equally.",
        "They are too focused on cognitive aspects of language."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,

        "It dismisses the importance of context."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
