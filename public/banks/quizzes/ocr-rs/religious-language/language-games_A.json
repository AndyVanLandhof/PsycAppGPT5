        "It depends on context",
        "It is always cognitive",
        "It is irrelevant to philosophy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Wittgenstein argues that the meaning of language is determined by its context and the rules of the specific language game being played. This corresponds to: It depends on context."

      "question": "How does Wittgenstein's concept of language games respond to the challenge posed by Logical Positivism regarding religious language?",

        "It suggests religious statements are meaningless",
        "It argues that religious language is meaningful within its own context",
        "It denies the existence of God"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Wittgenstein's language games suggest that religious language is meaningful within the context of the beliefs and practices of the religious community. This corresponds to: It argues that religious language is meaningful within its own context."

        "As a literal truth",
        "As a meaningful statement within the Christian language game",
        "As a cognitive claim",
        "As an irrelevant statement"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Wittgenstein would interpret 'God is love' as meaningful within the context of the Christian language game, but not necessarily as a literal truth. This corresponds to: As a meaningful statement within the Christian language game."

        "By emphasizing the fixed meanings of words",
        "By arguing that understanding depends on the form of life",
        "By denying the existence of God"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Malcolm's view that language is contextual aligns with Wittgenstein's idea that meaning is derived from the specific language game being played. This corresponds to: By arguing that understanding depends on the form of life."
