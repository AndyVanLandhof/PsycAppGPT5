    {
      "question": "What does the apophatic way (via negativa) emphasize when discussing God?",
      "options": [
        "Describing God positively",
        "Describing what God is not",
        "Using analogies to explain God",
        "Symbolic representations of God"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The apophatic way argues that the only legitimate way to talk about God is to say what He is not, such as 'God is infinite' or 'unknowable'. This corresponds to: Describing what God is not."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Pseudo-Dionysius, why is the apophatic way preferable to the cataphatic way?",
      "options": [
        "It allows for a clearer understanding of God",
        "It preserves the mystery of God",
        "It uses everyday language",
        "It is more relatable to humans"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Pseudo-Dionysius argues that apophatic language preserves the mystery of God, avoiding anthropomorphism inherent in cataphatic descriptions. This corresponds to: It preserves the mystery of God."
    },
    {
      "question": "In what way does Aquinas' analogy of attribution help in discussing God's nature?",
      "options": [
        "It uses negative statements",
        "It allows for direct comparisons with human qualities",
        "It provides a univocal understanding of God",
        "It suggests that human language can describe God accurately"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Aquinas' analogy of attribution allows for comparisons between God and human qualities, but it acknowledges that these comparisons are not direct. This corresponds to: It allows for direct comparisons with human qualities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key criticism of the cataphatic way (via positiva)?",
      "options": [
        "It is too abstract",
        "It risks anthropomorphizing God",
        "It is too simplistic",
        "It is universally accepted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cataphatic way risks anthropomorphizing God by using human terms, which may misrepresent God's true nature. This corresponds to: It risks anthropomorphizing God."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Tillich view theological language?",
      "options": [
        "As entirely literal",
        "As almost entirely symbolic",
        "As primarily negative",
        "As universally applicable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tillich argues that theological language is almost entirely symbolic, emphasizing the limitations of human language in describing God. This corresponds to: As almost entirely symbolic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Moses Maimonides suggested that describing God through negation leads to what outcome?",
      "options": [
        "A clearer understanding of God",
        "A misunderstanding of God's nature",
        "A closer approximation of God's essence",
        "A complete description of God"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Maimonides claimed that by describing God only through what He is not, one can arrive closer to understanding God's essence. This corresponds to: A closer approximation of God's essence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue with using analogy to describe God?",
      "options": [
        "It is too vague",
        "It requires univocal language",
        "It is universally accepted",
        "It does not allow for personal interpretation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that analogy requires translating terms into univocal language first, complicating the understanding of God's nature. This corresponds to: It requires univocal language."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the term 'equivocal' mean in the context of religious language?",
      "options": [
        "Words have the same meaning when applied to God",
        "Words have different meanings when applied to God",
        "Words are universally understood",
        "Words are always negative"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In religious language, 'equivocal' means that words used about God can have different meanings than when used in everyday contexts. This corresponds to: Words have different meanings when applied to God."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a strength of the apophatic way in discussing God?",
      "options": [
        "It provides clear definitions",
        "It avoids misrepresentation of God's nature",
        "It is easily understood by everyone",
        "It allows for personal interpretations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The apophatic way avoids misrepresentation by emphasizing what God is not, thus maintaining the transcendence of God. This corresponds to: It avoids misrepresentation of God's nature."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the cataphatic way (via positiva)?",
      "options": [
        "It uses negative statements about God",
        "It describes God using positive attributes",
        "It avoids any description of God",
        "It relies solely on symbolic language"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cataphatic way uses positive language to describe God's qualities, such as 'God is good' or 'God is loving'. This corresponds to: It describes God using positive attributes."
