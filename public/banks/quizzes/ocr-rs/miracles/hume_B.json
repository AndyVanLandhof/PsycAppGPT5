      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hume would argue that the first step should be to compare the claim to known natural laws, as miracles are defined as violations of these laws. This corresponds to: Compare it to known natural laws."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hume posits that the improbability of miracles makes it more likely that they are fabrications rather than actual occurrences. This corresponds to: They are more likely to be fabrications than truths."
