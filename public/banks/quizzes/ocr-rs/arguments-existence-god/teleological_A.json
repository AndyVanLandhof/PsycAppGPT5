    {
      "question": "What analogy did William Paley use to support his teleological argument in his book 'Natural Theology'?",
      "options": [
        "A watch",
        "A tree",
        "A river",
        "A mountain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Paley argued that just as a watch implies a watchmaker, the complexity of the world implies a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Hume, what is a significant flaw in using analogies to argue for the existence of God?",
      "options": [
        "They are too simplistic",
        "They rely on personal experience",
        "They assume the world is like a machine",
        "They are based on faith"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hume challenged the analogy by stating that the world may not be comparable to a machine like a watch. This corresponds to: They assume the world is like a machine."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Paley argue about natural bodies in his teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "They are random",
        "They are fit for purpose",
        "They are flawed",
        "They are irrelevant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Paley concluded that all natural bodies are suitably designed for their purposes. This corresponds to: They are fit for purpose."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the teleological argument, what does the Epicurean hypothesis suggest?",
      "options": [
        "Design implies a designer",
        "Randomness can explain the universe",
        "The universe is a machine",
        "Purpose is inherent in nature"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume's Epicurean hypothesis posits that given infinite time, particles could combine randomly to create a stable universe. This corresponds to: Randomness can explain the universe."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the challenge of evolution relate to the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It supports the existence of a designer",
        "It suggests design is an illusion",
        "It confirms Paley's observations",
        "It is irrelevant to the argument"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Evolution suggests that the appearance of design in organisms is due to natural selection rather than a purposeful designer. This corresponds to: It suggests design is an illusion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a common criticism of the teleological argument regarding the concept of chance?",
      "options": [
        "It assumes all design is intentional",
        "It ignores the role of evolution",
        "It cannot account for randomness",
        "It relies too heavily on observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the teleological argument fails to adequately address the possibility that randomness can explain the complexity of the universe. This corresponds to: It cannot account for randomness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes Hume's view on the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It is logically sound",
        "It is based on flawed analogies",
        "It proves the existence of God",
        "It is universally accepted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume's criticisms focus on the inadequacy of analogies used in the teleological argument, questioning their validity. This corresponds to: It is based on flawed analogies."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Paley's observation of the eye illustrate in his teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "The complexity of design",
        "The randomness of evolution",
        "The simplicity of nature",
        "The irrelevance of purpose"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Paley used the eye as an example of a complex organ that is perfectly designed for its purpose, supporting his argument for a designer. This corresponds to: The complexity of design."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Hume, what might the world be more accurately compared to instead of a watch?",
      "options": [
        "A machine",
        "A vegetable",
        "A book",
        "A painting"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume suggested that the world could be more like a vegetable, which has complexity but does not imply a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one way in which modern teleological arguments attempt to remain relevant despite challenges from evolution?",
      "options": [
        "They ignore evolution",
        "They incorporate the anthropic principle",
        "They reject the idea of design",
        "They focus solely on scripture"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Modern teleological arguments often use the anthropic principle to reconcile the appearance of design with evolutionary theory. This corresponds to: They incorporate the anthropic principle."
