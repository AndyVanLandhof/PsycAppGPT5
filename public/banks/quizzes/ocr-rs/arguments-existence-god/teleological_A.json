    {
      "question": "What analogy did William Paley use to support the teleological argument in his book 'Natural Theology'?",
      "options": [
        "A watch",
        "A tree",
        "A river",
        "A mountain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Paley argued that just as a watch implies a watchmaker, the complexity of the world implies a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Paley, what does the observation that all natural bodies are fit for purpose suggest?",
      "options": [
        "They evolved randomly",
        "They are designed",
        "They are accidental",
        "They are illusory"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Paley concluded that the suitability of natural bodies for their purposes indicates a designer. This corresponds to: They are designed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of Hume's criticisms challenges the analogy used in the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "The world is not like a watch",
        "Design is not necessary",
        "Evolution explains complexity",
        "God is not needed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Hume argued that the world may be more like a vegetable than a machine, questioning the analogy's validity. This corresponds to: The world is not like a watch."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hume's Epicurean hypothesis suggests that the universe could arise from what?",
      "options": [
        "A divine creator",
        "Random combinations of particles",
        "Intelligent design",
        "Natural selection"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume proposed that given infinite time, particles could combine randomly to create a stable universe. This corresponds to: Random combinations of particles."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a modern context, how might teleological arguments respond to the challenge of evolution?",
      "options": [
        "They are irrelevant",
        "They incorporate evolution",
        "They reject evolution",
        "They ignore it"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Modern teleological arguments may use concepts from evolution to argue for design despite natural selection. This corresponds to: They incorporate evolution."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a student argues that the teleological argument is still relevant today, which principle might they invoke?",
      "options": [
        "Anthropic principle",
        "Causal principle",
        "Moral principle",
        "Aesthetic principle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The anthropic principle suggests that the universe's conditions allow for human life, indicating design"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key methodological issue in evaluating the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It relies on subjective experience",
        "It assumes a designer without proof",
        "It is too complex",
        "It is universally accepted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the teleological argument jumps to the conclusion of a designer without sufficient evidence. This corresponds to: It assumes a designer without proof."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Hume's critique of the teleological argument relate to the concept of chance?",
      "options": [
        "It supports the idea of chance",
        "It denies the existence of chance",
        "It suggests chance is irrelevant",
        "It argues chance explains design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Hume's challenges suggest that randomness and chance could account for the universe's complexity, not design. This corresponds to: It argues chance explains design."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes Paley's view on the purpose of natural organisms?",
      "options": [
        "They are random",
        "They are designed for specific functions",
        "They are accidental",
        "They are evolving"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Paley argued that natural organisms are perfectly designed to fulfill specific purposes, indicating a designer. This corresponds to: They are designed for specific functions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the challenge of evolution imply for the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It strengthens the argument",
        "It undermines the need for a designer",
        "It is irrelevant",
        "It confirms the existence of God"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Evolution suggests that complexity can arise through natural processes, challenging the necessity of a designer. This corresponds to: It undermines the need for a designer."
