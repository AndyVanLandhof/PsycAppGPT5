    {
      "question": "What analogy did William Paley use to support the Teleological Argument?",
      "options": [
        "A watch",
        "A tree",
        "A river",
        "A mountain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Paley used the analogy of a watch to illustrate that complex design implies a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Paley, what does the observation that all natural bodies are fit for purpose suggest?",
      "options": [
        "They evolved randomly",
        "They are designed by a designer",
        "They are mere coincidences",
        "They are products of chance"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Paley argued that the suitability of natural bodies for their purposes indicates the existence of a designer. This corresponds to: They are designed by a designer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was one of Hume's main criticisms of the Teleological Argument?",
      "options": [
        "The world is not like a machine",
        "Design is evident in nature",
        "The universe is finite",
        "God is not necessary for design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Hume challenged the analogy used in the Teleological Argument, asserting that the world is not necessarily like a machine. This corresponds to: The world is not like a machine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hume's Epicurean hypothesis suggests that the universe could be explained by what?",
      "options": [
        "A designer God",
        "Random combinations of particles",
        "Natural selection",
        "A cosmic creator"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume proposed that given infinite time, particles could combine randomly to create a stable universe, negating the need for a designer. This corresponds to: Random combinations of particles."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the Teleological Argument, what does the anthropic principle suggest?",
      "options": [
        "The universe is designed for human existence",
        "Evolution negates the need for a designer",
        "Chance is the primary factor in existence",
        "Design is evident in all organisms"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The anthropic principle posits that the universe's conditions are finely tuned for human life, suggesting intentional design. This corresponds to: The universe is designed for human existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a modern teleological argument incorporates evolution, what might it argue?",
      "options": [
        "Evolution disproves design",
        "Design can be seen in evolutionary adaptations",
        "Natural selection is random",
        "All organisms are perfectly designed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Modern teleological arguments may argue that evolutionary adaptations demonstrate design, despite the randomness of natural selection. This corresponds to: Design can be seen in evolutionary adaptations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential weakness of the Teleological Argument when considering evolution?",
      "options": [
        "It relies solely on observation",
        "It does not account for randomness",
        "It assumes a designer is necessary",
        "It is too complex to understand"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The challenge of evolution suggests that apparent design can arise from random processes, undermining the necessity of a designer. This corresponds to: It does not account for randomness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes Hume's view on the analogy used in the Teleological Argument?",
      "options": [
        "It is a strong comparison",
        "It is misleading",
        "It is universally accepted",
        "It is scientifically proven"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume viewed the analogy as misleading, arguing that the world does not necessarily resemble a machine like a watch. This corresponds to: It is misleading."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Paley's argument imply about the existence of God?",
      "options": [
        "God is irrelevant",
        "God is a necessary designer",
        "God is a product of human imagination",
        "God's existence is uncertain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Paley's argument implies that the complexity and purposefulness of nature necessitate the existence of a designer God. This corresponds to: God is a necessary designer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What logical fallacy might be present in the Teleological Argument according to critics?",
      "options": [
        "Begging the question",
        "False dichotomy",
        "Post hoc reasoning",
        "Appeal to authority"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the Teleological Argument may beg the question by assuming that design necessarily implies a designer without sufficient evidence. This corresponds to: Begging the question."
