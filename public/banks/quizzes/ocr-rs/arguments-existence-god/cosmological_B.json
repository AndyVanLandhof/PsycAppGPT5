    {
      "question": "Which of Aquinas' first three ways is primarily concerned with the concept of motion?",
      "options": [
        "The First Way",
        "The Second Way",
        "The Third Way",
        "The Fourth Way"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The First Way argues that everything in motion must have been set in motion by something else, leading to the necessity of a first mover"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main premise of the cosmological argument as proposed by Aquinas?",
      "options": [
        "Everything has a purpose",
        "Everything must have a cause",
        "The universe is an illusion",
        "God is unknowable"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Aquinas' cosmological argument asserts that everything that begins to exist must have a cause, ultimately leading to the existence of a first cause, which is God. This corresponds to: Everything must have a cause."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the cosmological argument, what does 'a posteriori' reasoning rely on?",
      "options": [
        "Logical deduction",
        "Empirical evidence",
        "Mathematical proof",
        "Intuition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "'A posteriori' reasoning relies on empirical data and observations to argue for the existence of God, as seen in the cosmological argument. This corresponds to: Empirical evidence."
    },
    {
      "question": "David Hume challenged the cosmological argument by questioning the necessity of a first cause. What is one of his key criticisms?",
      "options": [
        "The universe is eternal",
        "God is not a necessary being",
        "Causation is a human construct",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Hume argued that the universe could be eternal and that our understanding of causation does not necessarily apply to the universe as a whole. This corresponds to: All of the above."
    },
    {
      "question": "Copleston and Russell engaged in a famous debate regarding the cosmological argument. What was a key point of contention?",
      "options": [
        "The existence of multiple gods",
        "The nature of causation",
        "The morality of God",
        "The role of faith"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Copleston defended the necessity of a first cause, while Russell questioned whether the universe needed an explanation beyond itself. This corresponds to: The nature of causation."
    },
    {
      "question": "One criticism of the cosmological argument is that it jumps to the conclusion of a transcendent creator. What is this known as?",
      "options": [
        "Begging the question",
        "Post hoc reasoning",
        "False dichotomy",
        "Straw man argument"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "This criticism suggests that the argument assumes what it is trying to prove, which is a logical fallacy known as begging the question"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the term 'telos' refer to in the context of the cosmological argument?",
      "options": [
        "Cause",
        "Effect",
        "Purpose",
        "Design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "In philosophical discussions, 'telos' refers to the purpose or end goal, which is often invoked in arguments for the existence of God"
    },
    {
      "question": "Hume's challenge to the cosmological argument includes the assertion that we cannot infer the existence of God from the existence of the universe. What is this criticism called?",
      "options": [
        "The problem of evil",
        "The fallacy of composition",
        "The argument from design",
        "The argument from contingency"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume's fallacy of composition suggests that just because individual things in the universe have causes does not mean the universe itself must have a cause. This corresponds to: The fallacy of composition."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the nature of the cosmological argument?",
      "options": [
        "A priori",
        "A posteriori",
        "Deductive",
        "Inductive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cosmological argument is an a posteriori argument, as it is based on observation and experience of the universe"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a common objection to the cosmological argument regarding the nature of the universe?",
      "options": [
        "It is too complex",
        "It is not observable",
        "It may be infinite",
        "It is inherently flawed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "One objection is that the universe may be infinite and eternal, which challenges the need for a first cause as proposed by the cosmological argument. This corresponds to: It may be infinite."
