      "question": "Which of Aquinas' first three ways in the cosmological argument focuses on motion?",

        "The Third Way",
        "The Fourth Way"

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The First Way argues from motion, stating that everything in motion must have been set in motion by something else"

      "question": "What is the primary focus of the cosmological argument as proposed by Aquinas?",
      "options": [
        "The existence of design",

        "The existence of religious experiences"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cosmological argument emphasizes the need for a first cause to explain the existence of the universe. This corresponds to: The existence of a first cause."

      "question": "In the cosmological argument, what does Aquinas' Second Way address?",

        "Contingency",

        "Motion",
        "Design"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Second Way focuses on causation, arguing that everything that exists has a cause"

      "question": "David Hume challenged the cosmological argument by questioning the necessity of a first cause. What is one of his key criticisms?",
      "options": [
        "The universe is eternal",
        "The universe is designed",
        "The universe is contingent",
        "The universe is a product of chance"

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Hume argued that the universe could be eternal and does not necessarily require a first cause. This corresponds to: The universe is eternal."

        "Post hoc reasoning",
        "Slippery slope"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Hume suggested that the cosmological argument may beg the question by assuming the necessity of a first cause without sufficient evidence. This corresponds to: Begging the question."

    {
      "question": "What is a key strength of the cosmological argument related to empirical evidence?",
      "options": [
        "It relies on a priori reasoning",
        "It uses observable phenomena",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cosmological argument uses observable phenomena, such as cause and effect, to argue for the existence of God. This corresponds to: It uses observable phenomena."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Contingency refers to the idea that the universe depends on something else for its existence. This corresponds to: The universe's dependence on something else."

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The theory of evolution offers a natural explanation for complexity in the universe, challenging the need for a divine creator. This corresponds to: It provides a natural explanation for complexity."
