    {
      "question": "Which of Aquinas' first three ways is primarily concerned with the concept of motion?",
      "options": [
        "The First Way",
        "The Second Way",
        "The Third Way",
        "The Fourth Way"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The First Way argues from motion, suggesting that everything in motion must have been set in motion by something else"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main premise of the cosmological argument as proposed by Aquinas?",
      "options": [
        "Everything has a purpose",
        "Everything must have a cause",
        "The universe is an illusion",
        "God is the only necessary being"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cosmological argument posits that everything must have a cause, leading to the conclusion of a first cause, which is God"
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the cosmological argument, what does the term 'contingent being' refer to?",
      "options": [
        "A being that exists necessarily",
        "A being that relies on another for existence",
        "A being that is eternal",
        "A being that has no purpose"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A contingent being is one that depends on something else for its existence, contrasting with a necessary being. This corresponds to: A being that relies on another for existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "David Hume challenged the cosmological argument by questioning the assumption of causation. What was one of his key criticisms?",
      "options": [
        "The universe is infinite",
        "Cause and effect cannot be observed",
        "The existence of God is self-evident",
        "All effects have multiple causes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Hume argued that the universe could be infinite and that we cannot assume that everything must have a cause, challenging the cosmological argument. This corresponds to: The universe is infinite."

    {
      "question": "Copleston and Russell engaged in a famous debate regarding the cosmological argument. What was Russell's main objection?",
      "options": [
        "The universe is not contingent",
        "The universe requires a cause",
        "The existence of God is not necessary",
        "Causation is a human construct"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Russell argued that the existence of the universe does not necessitate a cause, thus challenging the cosmological argument. This corresponds to: The existence of God is not necessary."

      "question": "Which of the following is a strength of the cosmological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It relies on empirical evidence",
        "It is based on logical reasoning",
        "It provides a definitive proof of God",
        "It is universally accepted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cosmological argument is based on logical reasoning about causation, which many find compelling. This corresponds to: It is based on logical reasoning."
    },
    {
      "question": "One criticism of the cosmological argument is that it jumps to the conclusion of a transcendent creator. What does this imply?",
      "options": [
        "It lacks sufficient evidence",
        "It is universally accepted",
        "It is based on empirical data",
        "It is a logical necessity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the cosmological argument does not provide enough evidence to justify the leap to a transcendent creator. This corresponds to: It lacks sufficient evidence."

    {
      "question": "What is a potential logical fallacy found in the cosmological argument?",
      "options": [
        "Begging the question",
        "Post hoc reasoning",
        "False dichotomy",
        "Ad hominem"

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The cosmological argument may commit the fallacy of begging the question by assuming what it seeks to prove"

      "question": "Aquinas' cosmological argument is classified as which type of argument?",
      "options": [
        "A priori",
        "A posteriori",
        "Deductive",
        "Inductive"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Aquinas' cosmological argument is an a posteriori argument, relying on observation and experience to infer the existence of God"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes the nature of the cosmological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It is based on the design of the universe",
        "It focuses on the existence of evil",
        "It examines the cause of the universe",
        "It relies on moral reasoning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The cosmological argument specifically examines the cause of the universe, arguing that everything that exists has a cause. This corresponds to: It examines the cause of the universe."
