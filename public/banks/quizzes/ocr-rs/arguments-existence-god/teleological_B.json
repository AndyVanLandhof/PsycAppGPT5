    {
      "question": "What analogy did William Paley use to support his teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "A watch",
        "A tree",
        "A river",
        "A mountain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Paley argued that just as a watch implies a watchmaker, the complexity of the world implies a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Hume, what is a significant flaw in using analogies to argue for the existence of God?",
      "options": [
        "They are too simplistic",
        "They rely on subjective interpretation",
        "They do not necessarily prove causation",
        "They are based on outdated science"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hume challenged the suitability of analogies, arguing that the world may not be comparable to a designed object like a watch. This corresponds to: They do not necessarily prove causation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Paley's observation of natural organisms suggest in his teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "They are random",
        "They are fit for purpose",
        "They are flawed",
        "They are evolving"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Paley concluded that the suitability of natural bodies for their purposes indicates a designer. This corresponds to: They are fit for purpose."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hume's Epicurean hypothesis suggests that the universe could be explained by what?",
      "options": [
        "A divine creator",
        "Natural selection",
        "Randomness over time",
        "A cosmic accident"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hume proposed that given infinite time, particles could combine randomly to create a stable universe, negating the need for a designer. This corresponds to: Randomness over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "In evaluating the teleological argument, one might consider whether it can withstand the challenge of chance. What is this challenge?",
      "options": [
        "That design is evident in nature",
        "That evolution explains complexity",
        "That randomness can produce order",
        "That purpose is subjective"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The challenge of chance argues that the apparent design in nature could arise from random processes rather than intentional design. This corresponds to: That randomness can produce order."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a student argues that modern teleological arguments incorporate evolution, which point are they likely making?",
      "options": [
        "Evolution disproves design",
        "Design is evident in evolution",
        "Natural selection is random",
        "Purpose is irrelevant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "This argument suggests that while evolution explains adaptation, it does not negate the idea of a designer behind the process. This corresponds to: Design is evident in evolution."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue in Paley's teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It relies on subjective experience",
        "It assumes all complexity implies design",
        "It does not consider alternative explanations",
        "It is based on outdated biology"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Paley's argument is criticized for not adequately addressing alternative explanations for complexity, such as evolution. This corresponds to: It does not consider alternative explanations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following best describes Hume's overall stance on the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It is logically sound",
        "It is based on flawed reasoning",
        "It is a valid proof of God",
        "It is outdated"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume's critiques highlight logical flaws in the teleological argument, suggesting it does not convincingly prove the existence of God. This corresponds to: It is based on flawed reasoning."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary focus of Aquinas' Fifth Way in relation to the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "The existence of evil",
        "The need for a first cause",
        "The order and purpose in nature",
        "The nature of faith"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Aquinas' Fifth Way argues that the order and purpose observed in nature imply the existence of an intelligent designer. This corresponds to: The order and purpose in nature."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which principle suggests that the universe's existence can be explained without a designer?",
      "options": [
        "Anthropic principle",
        "Causality principle",
        "Evolutionary principle",
        "Design principle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The anthropic principle posits that the universe's conditions are suitable for life, which can be explained without invoking a designer"
