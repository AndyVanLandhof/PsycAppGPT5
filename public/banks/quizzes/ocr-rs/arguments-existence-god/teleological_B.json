    {
      "question": "What analogy did William Paley use to support the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "A watch",
        "A tree",
        "A river",
        "A mountain"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Paley argued that just as a watch implies a watchmaker, the complexity of the world implies a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Paley, what does the observation of natural organisms suggest?",
      "options": [
        "They evolved randomly",
        "They are fit for purpose",
        "They are purely accidental",
        "They are illusions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Paley concluded that all natural bodies are suitably designed for their purposes, indicating a designer. This corresponds to: They are fit for purpose."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one of Hume's criticisms of the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "The world is like a watch",
        "The analogy is not suitable",
        "Design is evident in chaos",
        "All things are fit for purpose"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume challenged the analogy by arguing that the world is not necessarily like a watch and may resemble a complex natural object. This corresponds to: The analogy is not suitable."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the context of the teleological argument, what does the Epicurean hypothesis suggest?",
      "options": [
        "Design implies a designer",
        "Randomness explains the universe",
        "Everything is predetermined",
        "Nature is chaotic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Epicurean hypothesis posits that given infinite time, particles can combine in every possible way, leading to a stable universe without a designer. This corresponds to: Randomness explains the universe."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a modern teleological argument incorporates evolution, what does it suggest about design?",
      "options": [
        "Design is irrelevant",
        "Design is a result of natural selection",
        "Design is purely accidental",
        "Design is a myth"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Modern teleological arguments may argue that the appearance of design in organisms is a result of natural selection rather than direct creation. This corresponds to: Design is a result of natural selection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How might the anthropic principle relate to the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It denies the existence of God",
        "It supports random chance",
        "It combines design with evolution",
        "It rejects observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The anthropic principle suggests that the universe's conditions allow for life, which can be interpreted as a combination of design and evolutionary processes. This corresponds to: It combines design with evolution."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential weakness of the teleological argument when considering evolution?",
      "options": [
        "It relies solely on observation",
        "It ignores the concept of chance",
        "It cannot explain complexity",
        "It assumes a benevolent designer"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Critics argue that the teleological argument does not adequately address the challenge of chance, as evolution can produce complexity without a designer. This corresponds to: It ignores the concept of chance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What logical fallacy might be present in the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "Post hoc reasoning",
        "Circular reasoning",
        "Hasty generalization",
        "False dichotomy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The teleological argument may fall into post hoc reasoning by assuming that because design is observed, it must have a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Hume argue about the nature of the universe in relation to the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "It is perfectly designed",
        "It is chaotic and random",
        "It is a product of divine intervention",
        "It is a reflection of human perception"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume contends that the universe could be explained by randomness rather than a divine designer, challenging the teleological argument. This corresponds to: It is chaotic and random."
    },
    {
      "question": "What aspect of Paley's argument is often defended by modern proponents of the teleological argument?",
      "options": [
        "Irreducible complexity",
        "Random chance",
        "Materialism",
        "A priori reasoning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Modern defenders of the teleological argument may invoke the concept of irreducible complexity to argue that certain biological structures are too complex to have arisen by chance"
