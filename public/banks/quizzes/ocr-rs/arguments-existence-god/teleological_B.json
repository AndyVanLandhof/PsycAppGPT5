    {
      "question": "What analogy did William Paley use to support the Teleological Argument?",
      "options": [
        "A watch",
        "A tree",
        "A mountain",
        "A river"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Paley argued that just as a watch implies a watchmaker, the complexity of the world implies a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "According to Paley, what does the observation that all things are fit for purpose suggest?",
      "options": [
        "Random chance",
        "Natural selection",
        "A designer",
        "An illusion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Paley concluded that the suitability of natural bodies for their purposes indicates the existence of a designer"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a criticism of the Teleological Argument presented by David Hume?",
      "options": [
        "The universe is like a watch",
        "The analogy is not suitable",
        "Design implies a designer",
        "Natural bodies are fit for purpose"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume rejected the analogy of the world being like a watch, arguing that it is not necessarily true. This corresponds to: The analogy is not suitable."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hume's Epicurean hypothesis suggests that the universe could arise from what?",
      "options": [
        "A divine creator",
        "Random combinations of particles",
        "Natural selection",
        "A predetermined plan"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hume proposed that given infinite time, particles could combine randomly to create a stable universe. This corresponds to: Random combinations of particles."
    },
    {
      "question": "In evaluating the Teleological Argument, one might argue that natural selection provides an alternative explanation for design. What does this suggest?",
      "options": [
        "Design is irrelevant",
        "Design is intentional",
        "Design can arise from chance",
        "Design is a fallacy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Natural selection implies that what appears designed may actually result from random processes rather than intentional design. This corresponds to: Design can arise from chance."
    },
    {
      "question": "If modern teleological arguments incorporate evolution, what is one potential strength they might have?",
      "options": [
        "They eliminate the need for a designer",
        "They align with scientific understanding",
        "They reject all forms of chance",
        "They rely solely on observation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Incorporating evolution allows modern teleological arguments to align with scientific explanations of complexity. This corresponds to: They align with scientific understanding."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a methodological issue that can be raised against the Teleological Argument?",
      "options": [
        "It relies solely on a priori reasoning",
        "It assumes all complexity requires a designer",
        "It is based on subjective experience",
        "It does not consider alternative explanations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The argument is often criticized for not adequately addressing alternative explanations like chance or natural processes. This corresponds to: It does not consider alternative explanations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which principle suggests that the universe's conditions are fine-tuned for life, supporting the Teleological Argument?",
      "options": [
        "Anthropic principle",
        "Causal principle",
        "Moral principle",
        "Aesthetic principle"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The anthropic principle posits that the universe's conditions are precisely suited for life, suggesting intentional design"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one of Hume's challenges to the Cosmological Argument that can also apply to the Teleological Argument?",
      "options": [
        "It assumes a first cause",
        "It relies on observation",
        "It does not prove God's existence",
        "It is based on faith"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Hume argued that neither argument conclusively proves the existence of God, highlighting a fundamental weakness. This corresponds to: It does not prove God's existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the 'blind watchmaker' concept suggest in relation to the Teleological Argument?",
      "options": [
        "Design is intentional",
        "Evolution lacks foresight",
        "Nature is chaotic",
        "God is irrelevant"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'blind watchmaker' concept indicates that evolution can create complexity without a guiding intelligence, challenging the argument for design. This corresponds to: Evolution lacks foresight."
