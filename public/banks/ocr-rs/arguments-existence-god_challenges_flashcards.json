      "question": "How does the Ontological Argument apply to this scenario: A person feels that the concept of God entails His existence?",

      "question": "Apply the Teleological Argument to this scenario: A person is amazed by the complexity of the human eye.",

      "question": "How does the Cosmological Argument apply to this scenario: Someone questions why the universe exists at all?",
