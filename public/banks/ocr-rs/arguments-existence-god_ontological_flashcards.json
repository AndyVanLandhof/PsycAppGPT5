    {
      "question": "What is the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "A priori argument proposing that God's existence is self-evident through logical analysis of the concept of God as the greatest conceivable being.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'a priori' in the context of philosophical arguments.",
      "answer": "A priori refers to knowledge or justification independent of experience, relying on logical reasoning and definitions.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Who formulated the original Ontological Argument and when?",
      "answer": "St. Anselm of Canterbury formulated the original Ontological Argument in the 11th century.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Anselm's definition of God?",
      "answer": "Anselm defines God as 'that than which nothing greater can be conceived.'",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Descartes add to the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "Descartes argued that existence is a perfection and God, being perfect, must therefore exist.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'necessary existence' in the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "Necessary existence means that God's existence is not contingent but must exist in all possible worlds.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Gaunilo criticize in Anselm's argument?",
      "answer": "Gaunilo used the analogy of a perfect island to argue that Anselm's logic could justify the existence of anything defined as perfect.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Kant's critique of the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "Kant argued that existence is not a predicate and thus cannot be part of the definition of God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between analytic and synthetic statements?",
      "answer": "Analytic statements are true by definition, while synthetic statements require empirical evidence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a predicate in Kant's critique?",
      "answer": "A predicate is a property or quality that a subject can possess; Kant argued existence is not one.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Summarize Malcolm's contribution to the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "Malcolm argued that God has necessary existence, redefining the argument to focus on God's impossibility of non-existence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Plantinga's Modal Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "Plantinga uses modal logic to argue that if God's existence is possible in some world, then God exists in all possible worlds.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Anselm's Ontological Argument to the concept of a 'perfect island.'",
      "answer": "Anselm's argument fails as perfection in islands is subjective and doesn't necessitate existence like the concept of God does.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Kant's critique apply to Descartes' version of the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "Kant's critique undermines Descartes by asserting that existence is not a perfection but a condition of having properties.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the concept of 'necessary existence' to a non-theistic scenario.",
      "answer": "Necessary existence in mathematics: some propose numbers necessarily exist, independent of empirical reality, similar to the concept in the Ontological Argument.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How might Plantinga's argument apply to a multiverse theory?",
      "answer": "In a multiverse, if God exists in one universe, Plantinga's logic suggests God exists in all possible universes.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "It provides a logical, deductive framework supporting faith with reason by defining God as necessarily existing.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "The argument relies heavily on definitions and logic, making it unconvincing to those who prioritize empirical evidence.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodological critique of Kant on the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "Kant's critique highlights a key philosophical issue: treating existence as a predicate undermines the argument's logical foundation.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate Gaunilo's island analogy.",
      "answer": "Gaunilo's analogy effectively demonstrates the absurdity of Anselm's logic when applied to non-theistic entities, questioning the argument's validity.",
      "ao": "AO3"
