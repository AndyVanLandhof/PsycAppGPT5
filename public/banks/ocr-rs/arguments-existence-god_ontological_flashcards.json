    {
      "question": "What is the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "The Ontological Argument is a priori and deductive, asserting God's existence by defining God as the greatest conceivable being who must exist in reality.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'a priori' in the context of the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "A priori refers to knowledge or justification that is independent of experience, relying on logical reasoning.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Who first formulated the Ontological Argument and when?",
      "answer": "Saint Anselm formulated the Ontological Argument in the 11th century, specifically in his work 'Proslogion'.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was Anselm's main claim in the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "Anselm claimed that God, being the greatest conceivable being, must exist in reality because existence in reality is greater than existence in the mind alone.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'God' as per Anselm's Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "In Anselm’s argument, God is defined as 'that than which nothing greater can be conceived'.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did René Descartes contribute to the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "Descartes argued that existence is a perfection and thus, as a perfect being, God must exist.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'necessary existence' in the context of the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "Necessary existence refers to a being whose non-existence is impossible, a characteristic attributed to God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Gaunilo criticize about Anselm's argument?",
      "answer": "Gaunilo used the analogy of a perfect island, suggesting that conceiving the most perfect island doesn’t necessitate its existence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'perfect island' objection?",
      "answer": "The 'perfect island' objection, by Gaunilo, argues that Anselm’s logic could wrongly prove the existence of any perfect thing.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Immanuel Kant argue against the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "Kant argued that existence is not a predicate, meaning it doesn’t add to the concept of a thing.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'predicate' in Kant's critique.",
      "answer": "Predicate is a quality or attribute; Kant argued existence doesn’t function as a predicate that adds to the concept of God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Alvin Plantinga's contribution to the Ontological Argument?",
      "answer": "Plantinga introduced modal logic, suggesting that if God's existence is possible, then God exists in some possible worlds, implying existence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Anselm's argument apply to the concept of God in a fictional universe?",
      "answer": "In a fictional universe, Anselm's argument would still claim God exists, as the argument is based on logic, not empirical evidence.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Descartes' Ontological Argument to this scenario: A mathematician claims perfect numbers exist.",
      "answer": "Similar to Descartes’ claim that a perfect being must exist, a mathematician might argue that the concept of perfect numbers inherently includes their existence.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Gaunilo's perfect island apply to defining ideal concepts in economics?",
      "answer": "Gaunilo's argument suggests that defining an ideal economy does not prove its existence, highlighting the limits of conceptual analysis.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Kant's critique to the claim that 'the fastest car must exist'.",
      "answer": "Kant would argue that stating 'the fastest car must exist' is flawed, as existence doesn’t add anything to the concept of the fastest car.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "A strength is its reliance on logical reasoning, which doesn’t require empirical evidence, making it universally applicable.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "A limitation is its dependence on definitions; if one disagrees with the definition of God, the argument collapses.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Anselm's Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "Anselm’s argument uses deductive reasoning, which is rigorous but limited by its reliance on universally accepted premises.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate Kant's critique of the Ontological Argument.",
      "answer": "Kant’s critique is effective as it challenges the fundamental assumption of the argument, questioning the coherence of existence as a predicate.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    }
