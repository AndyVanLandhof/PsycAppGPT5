    {
      "question": "What is the Cosmological Argument?",
      "answer": "The Cosmological Argument posits that everything in existence has a cause, leading to the necessity of an uncaused first cause, often identified as God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'contingency' in the context of the Cosmological Argument.",
      "answer": "Contingency refers to things that exist but could have not existed; they depend on something else for their existence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Aquinas' First Way?",
      "answer": "Aquinas' First Way is the argument from motion, stating that everything in motion is moved by something else, ultimately requiring an unmoved mover.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Aquinas' Second Way?",
      "answer": "Aquinas' Second Way argues from causation, asserting that nothing causes itself and there must be a first uncaused cause.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Aquinas' Third Way?",
      "answer": "Aquinas' Third Way is the argument from contingency, claiming that contingent beings require a necessary being to exist.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Leibniz argue in his Principle of Sufficient Reason?",
      "answer": "Leibniz argued that everything must have a reason or cause, and the universe's existence requires an explanation, leading to the necessity of God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'necessary being' in the Cosmological Argument.",
      "answer": "A necessary being is one whose existence is not dependent on anything else and cannot not exist, typically identified as God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the concept of 'infinite regress' play in the Cosmological Argument?",
      "answer": "The argument rejects infinite regress, stating that an endless chain of causes is impossible, necessitating a first cause.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Kalam Cosmological Argument?",
      "answer": "The Kalam Cosmological Argument asserts that the universe had a beginning, and since everything that begins has a cause, the universe must have a cause.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Who developed the Kalam Cosmological Argument?",
      "answer": "The Kalam Cosmological Argument was developed by Islamic philosophers, notably Al-Ghazali, and later popularized by William Lane Craig.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Quentin Smith (1993) argue against the Cosmological Argument?",
      "answer": "Quentin Smith argued that quantum mechanics shows that some events are uncaused, challenging the necessity of a first cause.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did David Hume argue about causation?",
      "answer": "David Hume argued that our belief in causation is based on habit and experience, not logical necessity, challenging the Cosmological Argument.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Cosmological Argument apply to the existence of the universe?",
      "answer": "The argument suggests the universe's existence requires an explanation, positing God as the necessary first cause.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Aquinas' Third Way to a contingent object.",
      "answer": "A contingent object, like a tree, depends on external factors to exist. Aquinas' Third Way posits the necessity of a non-contingent being, God, for its existence.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Kalam argument apply to the concept of time?",
      "answer": "The Kalam argument asserts that because the universe began in time, it must have a cause, challenging the idea of infinite past time.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the Principle of Sufficient Reason to a hypothetical universe.",
      "answer": "In a hypothetical universe, the Principle of Sufficient Reason demands an explanation for its existence, leading to the conclusion of a necessary being, God.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the Cosmological Argument.",
      "answer": "A strength is its intuitive appeal; it aligns with everyday experiences of causation and provides a simple explanation for the universe's existence.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the Cosmological Argument.",
      "answer": "A limitation is its assumption that the universe needs a cause, which may not apply outside our observable experience.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Aquinas' observations in his arguments.",
      "answer": "Aquinas' methodology relies on empirical observation and Aristotelian logic, which may not account for modern scientific understandings of causality.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the assumptions behind the Kalam Cosmological Argument.",
      "answer": "The Kalam argument assumes the universe had a beginning, a point contested by some interpretations of cosmology and quantum physics.",
      "ao": "AO3"
