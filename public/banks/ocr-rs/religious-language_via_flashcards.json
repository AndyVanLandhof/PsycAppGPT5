    {
      "question": "What is the Via Negativa?",
      "answer": "Via Negativa, or apophatic theology, is the approach to religious language that suggests the divine can only be described by negation, saying what God is not.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define analogical language in religious studies.",
      "answer": "Analogical language uses analogy to convey religious concepts, suggesting similarities between God's attributes and human experiences, without assuming they are identical.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Aquinas propose about analogical language?",
      "answer": "Aquinas proposed two types of analogy: analogy of attribution and analogy of proportion, to understand how human language can meaningfully refer to God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the analogy of attribution?",
      "answer": "The analogy of attribution suggests that qualities in humans can be attributed to God, but in a higher form, as God is the source of all qualities.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the analogy of proportion?",
      "answer": "The analogy of proportion compares attributes between beings, suggesting that God's qualities are proportionally greater than human qualities.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define univocal language.",
      "answer": "Univocal language refers to words that have exactly the same meaning when applied to God and humans, which is often rejected in religious language.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define equivocal language.",
      "answer": "Equivocal language refers to words that have completely different meanings when applied to God and humans, highlighting linguistic limitations.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Maimonides argue about Via Negativa?",
      "answer": "Maimonides argued that Via Negativa is the only way to speak of God, as human language cannot adequately describe the divine.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a criticism of the Via Negativa?",
      "answer": "Critics argue that Via Negativa offers limited understanding, as negations do not provide positive insights into God's nature.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an example of analogical language in religious texts?",
      "answer": "The Bible uses analogical language, e.g., referring to God as a 'shepherd,' suggesting care and guidance without literal interpretation.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Ian Ramsey contribute to the theory of analogy?",
      "answer": "Ian Ramsey suggested religious language involves 'models' and 'qualifiers' to explain divine attributes using human concepts while recognizing their limitations.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main purpose of using analogical language in religion?",
      "answer": "The purpose is to convey complex divine attributes in a relatable manner, facilitating understanding while maintaining God's transcendence.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Via Negativa apply to this scenario: Describing God's omniscience?",
      "answer": "Via Negativa would describe God's omniscience by stating God is not ignorant, avoiding positive assertions about divine knowledge.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply Aquinas' analogy of proportion to this scenario: Describing God's goodness.",
      "answer": "Aquinas' analogy of proportion suggests God's goodness is infinitely greater than human goodness, proportional to God's perfect nature.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does analogical language apply to this scenario: Explaining 'God as Father'?",
      "answer": "Analogical language uses 'God as Father' to convey nurturing and protective qualities, while acknowledging human fatherhood is imperfect.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the analogy of attribution to this scenario: Describing God as loving.",
      "answer": "The analogy of attribution suggests human love reflects divine love, as God is the ultimate source, but God's love is infinitely perfect.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of using Via Negativa.",
      "answer": "Via Negativa avoids anthropomorphism, preventing the reduction of God to human terms and maintaining the divine mystery.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of analogical language.",
      "answer": "Analogical language can be ambiguous, leading to misunderstandings about divine attributes and varying interpretations.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Maimonides' approach to Via Negativa.",
      "answer": "Maimonides' methodology is criticized for its extreme negation, offering little positive insight into God's character, limiting practical application.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate the effectiveness of Aquinas' analogies in religious language.",
      "answer": "Aquinas' analogies are effective in bridging the gap between divine and human language, but some argue they still fail to fully capture God's essence.",
      "ao": "AO3"
