    {
      "question": "What is the Teleological Argument?",
      "answer": "The Teleological Argument suggests that the order and purpose in the universe indicate the existence of an intelligent designer, typically identified as God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'Design qua Purpose' in the context of the Teleological Argument.",
      "answer": "Design qua Purpose refers to the idea that parts of the universe appear to serve specific functions, indicating intentional design.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'Design qua Regularity' in the context of the Teleological Argument.",
      "answer": "Design qua Regularity refers to the consistent and orderly nature of the universe, suggesting it is designed with regular laws.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did William Paley argue in 1802?",
      "answer": "Paley argued that the complexity of a watch implies a designer, and similarly, the complexity of the universe implies a divine creator.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Anthropic Principle?",
      "answer": "The Anthropic Principle suggests the universe's conditions are fine-tuned to allow for human life, implying intentional design.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Thomas Aquinas contribute to the Teleological Argument?",
      "answer": "Aquinas proposed the Fifth Way, arguing that non-intelligent objects act towards an end, suggesting a directing intelligence, i.e., God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Aesthetic Argument?",
      "answer": "The Aesthetic Argument claims the beauty in the world is not necessary for survival, suggesting a designer who appreciates beauty.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Richard Swinburne argue regarding probability?",
      "answer": "Swinburne argued that the probability of the universe being ordered by chance is low, supporting the argument for a designer.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Epicurean Hypothesis?",
      "answer": "The Epicurean Hypothesis posits that the universe's order could arise from random atomic movements over time, without needing a designer.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is David Hume and what was his critique?",
      "answer": "Hume criticized the Teleological Argument, suggesting that the universe's design could result from natural processes rather than a divine designer.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'Natural Theology' as used in the Teleological Argument.",
      "answer": "Natural Theology uses reason and observation of the natural world to argue for the existence of God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of analogy in Paley's argument?",
      "answer": "Paley uses analogy, comparing the universe to a watch, to argue that just as a watch has a designer, so must the universe.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the Teleological Argument to this scenario: A student sees the complexity in the DNA structure.",
      "answer": "The student may argue that the intricate design of DNA indicates an intelligent designer, supporting the Teleological Argument.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does 'Design qua Regularity' apply to the solar system?",
      "answer": "The regular orbits in the solar system can be seen as evidence of design, suggesting a designer established these consistent patterns.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the Anthropic Principle to this scenario: Human life depends on specific cosmic conditions.",
      "answer": "The Anthropic Principle suggests that the precise conditions necessary for human life point towards a universe designed with intention.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Aesthetic Argument apply to natural beauty like sunsets?",
      "answer": "Natural beauty, such as sunsets, may be seen as unnecessary for survival, suggesting a designer who values aesthetics.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the Teleological Argument.",
      "answer": "One strength is its intuitive appeal; the complexity and order of the universe naturally suggest an intelligent cause.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the Teleological Argument.",
      "answer": "A limitation is that the argument relies on analogy, which may not be a valid basis for drawing conclusions about the universe.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate Hume's critique of the Teleological Argument.",
      "answer": "Hume's critique is strong because it challenges the assumption that order implies design, suggesting natural processes could explain complexity.",
