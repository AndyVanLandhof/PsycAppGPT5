      "question": "What is the logical problem of evil?",
      "answer": "The logical problem of evil asserts that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'omnipotence' in the context of the problem of evil.",
      "answer": "Omnipotence refers to God's ability to do anything that is logically possible.",

    {
      "question": "What did Epicurus propose about God and evil?",

      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'inconsistent triad'?",
      "answer": "The inconsistent triad is the assertion that God's omnipotence, God's omnibenevolence, and the existence of evil cannot all be true simultaneously.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "Who developed the inconsistent triad?",
      "answer": "The inconsistent triad was popularized by J.L. Mackie in 1955.",

    {
      "question": "Define 'theodicy'.",

    {
      "question": "What is the 'free will defense'?",
      "answer": "The free will defense argues evil results from human free will, which God allows to enable genuine moral choices.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Define 'natural evil'.",
      "answer": "Natural evil refers to suffering not caused by humans, such as earthquakes or diseases.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What did Plantinga contribute to the problem of evil?",
      "answer": "Alvin Plantinga argued that free will is logically necessary for genuine moral good, thus explaining the existence of evil.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'evidential problem of evil'?",
      "answer": "The evidential problem of evil argues the amount and kinds of evil provide evidence against the existence of God.",
      "ao": "AO1"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the free will defense apply to a natural disaster?",
      "answer": "The free will defense may argue that natural laws, which allow for free will, can lead to natural disasters, not directly caused by God.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the inconsistent triad to this scenario: A child suffers from a disease.",
      "answer": "The inconsistent triad suggests God cannot be both omnipotent and omnibenevolent if a child suffers without reason.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does Plantinga's free will defense respond to human-caused suffering?",
      "answer": "Plantinga argues that God allows human-caused suffering due to the greater good of permitting free will.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Apply the logical problem of evil to a world with constant war.",
      "answer": "Constant war challenges the coexistence of an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God with evil, as war contradicts divine goodness or power.",
      "ao": "AO2"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one strength of the free will defense.",
      "answer": "The free will defense explains moral evil as a necessary consequence of free will, which is valuable for genuine moral choices.",
      "ao": "AO3"
    },
    {
      "question": "Give one limitation of the free will defense.",
      "answer": "The free will defense struggles to explain natural evil, which doesn't result from human choices.",

    {
      "question": "Evaluate the methodology of Mackie's inconsistent triad.",
      "answer": "Mackie's inconsistent triad is criticized for relying heavily on logical reasoning rather than empirical evidence.",
