      "levelDescriptor": "Low Level 3 - The response shows some understanding of the poems with basic analysis and some contextual awareness, but lacks depth and development.",
      "feedback": "This response demonstrates a basic understanding of both poems and makes some relevant comparisons, but lacks detailed analysis of poetic techniques and offers limited exploration of contexts. The argument is straightforward rather than nuanced, with minimal textual evidence to support points made.",
      "strengths": [
        "Identifies the central theme of death in both poems and recognizes their different approaches",
        "Makes some attempt to compare the poems' different tones and attitudes toward death",
        "Shows basic awareness of historical context for both poets",
        "Recognizes some structural elements like rhyme scheme in Larkin and rhythm in Dickinson",
        "Attempts to link form to meaning in a basic way"
      ],
      "improvements": [
        "Include specific quotations from both poems to support analysis",
        "Develop a more detailed analysis of poetic techniques (imagery, language, structure)",
        "Explore the poets' contexts in greater depth and with more specific detail",
        "Consider alternative interpretations of the poems rather than presenting a single reading",
        "Analyze how specific literary devices contribute to the poems' meanings and effects",
        "Develop a more sophisticated argument about the relationship between the poems",
        "Demonstrate wider reading and critical perspectives on the poets' work"
