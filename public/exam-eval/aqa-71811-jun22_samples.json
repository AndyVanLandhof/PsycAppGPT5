Additionally, she can demonstrate flexibility by listening to her classmates' concerns and being willing to adapt, like agreeing to have a theme everyone finds enjoyable or ensuring the party doesn’t clash with anyone’s schedules.

Prisoners were unexpectedly arrested at their homes, brought to the 'prison', deloused, and given uniforms and ID numbers. They were housed in small cells with three prisoners each and given basic rights like meals and toilet breaks. Guards wore uniforms, carried clubs, and wore reflective sunglasses to prevent eye contact. They were instructed to maintain order without physical violence.

Participants in the Stanford prison experiment experienced severe stress and emotional distress; for instance, some had to be released early due to extreme reactions. This suggests that the study was not adequately prepared to handle the psychological impact of the simulated prison environment, which questions whether the risks were ethically justified. Moreover, the participants' right to withdraw was compromised, as they felt pressured to continue, which further violates ethical guidelines."

Similarly, state-dependent forgetting is supported by Overton (1972), who found that people who learned material in a drunk state recalled it better when drunk again. These studies suggest that the absence of appropriate retrieval cues leads to forgetting. However, retrieval failure might be less influential when recognition tests, instead of free recall, are used, as recognition provides additional cues."

It effectively evaluates the model using evidence and critical analysis, which aligns with the mark scheme requirements for high-level responses.",
          "text": "The multi-store model of memory, proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968, describes memory as consisting of three distinct stores: the sensory register, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM). Information first enters the sensory register, which has a large capacity but very short duration, only lasting about half a second. Coding here is modality-specific, meaning it depends on the senses, like visual or auditory. Attention is required to transfer information from the sensory register to STM.\n\nSTM is described as having a limited capacity of 7±2 items, as suggested by Miller, and a duration of about 18-30 seconds without rehearsal. Information in STM is primarily coded acoustically. To retain information longer, it must be rehearsed, and through rehearsal, it can be transferred to LTM. LTM is considered to have unlimited capacity and can store information for a lifetime, with coding primarily semantic.\n\nOne strength of the multi-store model is that it is supported by research evidence. For example, Glanzer and Cunitz's (1966) serial position effect experiment supports the distinction between STM and LTM, showing that the recency effect occurs due to the last items being in STM, while the primacy effect reflects items rehearsed into LTM.\n\nHowever, the model is criticized for being too simplistic, viewing STM and LTM as unitary stores. Evidence from cases like KF, who had impaired verbal STM but intact visual STM, suggests that STM might have multiple components. Additionally, the model's emphasis on maintenance rehearsal is challenged by Craik and Tulving's (1975) finding that elaborative, or deeper processing, leads to better recall.\n\nOverall, while the multi-store model laid the foundation for understanding memory, it has been refined by further research that highlights the complexity of memory processes."

          "text": "The multi-store model of memory, by Atkinson and Shiffrin, describes memory as having three stores: sensory register, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM). The sensory register holds information from our senses for a very brief time, and if we pay attention, it moves to STM. STM has a limited capacity of around 7 items and lasts about 20 seconds unless rehearsed. Information can then be transferred to LTM, which has unlimited capacity and duration.\n\nOne strength is that the model is supported by research, like Glanzer and Cunitz's study showing the serial position effect. This supports the idea of separate STM and LTM stores. However, the model is criticized for being too simple. For example, case studies like KF show that STM might not be a single store as he could remember visual information but not verbal.\n\nOverall, the multi-store model is good for understanding how memory works, but it doesn't explain everything, like how memories are formed without rehearsal."

          "text": "The multi-store model of memory is a theory that explains memory in terms of three stores: sensory register, short-term memory, and long-term memory. The sensory register is where we first receive information, and if we pay attention, it goes to short-term memory. STM can hold a small amount of information for a short time. If we rehearse it, it can move to long-term memory, which can hold a lot of information for a long time.\n\nOne good thing about the model is that it explains how rehearsal moves information to long-term memory. But a problem is that it might be too simple because it doesn't explain everything, like how we remember things without rehearsing them.\n\nIn conclusion, the multi-store model gives a basic idea of how memory works, but there are more things that need to be explained."
