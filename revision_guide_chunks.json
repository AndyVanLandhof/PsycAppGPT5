    "title": "B. Theory of FORMs",
    "content": "Plato's THEORY OF FORMS stipulates that all things that we experience in this world are poor imitations of the true\nForms, which exist abstractly in the World of FORMS. Plato argued that when we experience particulars, e.g. trees, cats, acts\nof affection etc. we are in fact experiencing a fleeting and changing example. Through the example we are \"recognising\" a\ntrue FORM. E.g. when I see oak and pine and ash, I am seeing examples of the true FORM of tree.\nFORMs, then, are abstract ideas that have no physical existence. They are ideas that exist I the ethereal world or the world\nof ideas/FORMs. We can never experience them directly in this life, only recognise them through the particulars, the physical\nobjects we encounter in this life.\nThe theory of FORMs postulates that there is an ESSENTIAL FORM of the good, which is the highest of all FORMs. It is\nthrough this Essential FORM that we can recognise the FORMs at all. It is this Essential FORM, which gives us any concept\nof goodness; things are good if they reflect the Essential FORM of the good through their FORM and bad if they do not. The\nclearer the good shines through, the closer the example is to the FORM and the better it is.\nFor example, the idea of chair-ness is reflected into an example of a new and comfortable chair. GOODNESS is shining\nclearly through the new chair such that the example is a close reflection of the FORM of chair. However, over time and\nmisuse the chair becomes squeaky, torn and broken such that no longer is much goodness shining through the FORM so the\nexample is old and broken and no longer a clear reflection of the FORM of chair. However, the FORM of chair never changes;\nit eternal as are all the Forms e.g. maths, love, justice. They are all ETERNAL and cannot change.\nJustice is a FORM of knowing right from wrong. For Plato, if goodness shines through you, you are good, like the chair, you\nare a clear reflection of the FORM of man and the Essential FORM of Good is being shone through the FORM into you.\nIf you are a tyrant, then you are bad reflection.\n4",

When one of the prisoners is freed and takes the journey up the\njagged path into the sunlight, at first, he will not understand what he sees as he is used to life in the cave. However, given\ntime, his sight will adjust and he will realise that what he now sees, the puppets, the world etc. is the reality, given life by\nthe sun, and that what he experienced in the cave was the illusion.

In the same way that the free prisoner\ngains true knowledge by being freed from his restraints, crawling up the jagged path and seeing how the puppets cast\nshadows on the wall, we must free ourselves from our reliance on this world, become philosophers and accept that the\ntruth lies in the abstract FORMS and that only then can we see the truth.",

If all things are made of matter in a particular form, then\nthe world itself is also made of material with a form. Motion is the reduction from POTENTIALITY (the raw material) to\nACTUALITY (what it actually is, its form). Therefore, the world must have move from a potential state into its actual state\ntowards some TELOS (final cause), the PRIME MOVER, which itself allows all motion to take place at all. The Prime\nMover is not the EFFICIENT cause of the universe as every efficient cause is affected by what it moves, but the Prime\nMover cannot be moved or changed. Instead, the Prime Mover is like the sun attracting the flower towards it; the sun\nattracts the flower but the flower does not affect the sun.\nAristotle presented a number of characteristics of the Prime Mover, for example:\n• PURE ACTUALITY — The Prime Mover cannot itself be moved otherwise it cannot be the Prime Mover but one of a\nnumber of moved things.\n• SIMPLE — Given that it is pure actuality, the Prime Mover cannot be a complex being like humans, as complexity\nimplies complex form and motion.\n• GOOD — The Prime Mover cannot change and so cannot be improved.

Additionally, he witnessed souls emerging from the sky, having\nbeen rewarded, and the ground, having been punished, and then choosing new lives before drinking from the river of\nforgetfulness only to be born again.\nThis process myth was borrowed from the REINCARNATION beliefs of Pythagoras.

In the work, Aristotle discusses the nature of the\nrelationship between the body and the soul all stemming from his earlier argument for the FOUR CAUSES. Aristotle\nargues that the body and soul make up a HYLOMORPHIC body/soul unity. For Aristotle, there is no separate soul, but\nrather, the soul is the form and purpose of the body, the body in action. This can be seen through his explanation of\npotentiality and actuality and then of cause and effect.\nThe human being is matter in some form fulfilling some TELOS. the soul is the ACTUALITY of the body. Aristotle gives the\nwax stamp example to emphasise the unity between the body and soul. The stamp cannot be removed from the wax as\nthey are one unity. Likewise, whatever it is that makes the soul, the appearance, shape, character, personality etc. it is all part\nof the physical person; the soul is the form of the body, the actuality of the flesh, not something separate from it.\n• First potentiality — our material self with the potential to fulfil some TELOS.\n• Second potentiality/first actuality — our formal self with potential to enact a TELOS.\n• Second actuality — our purpose being engaged fulfilling a TELOS.\nThe soul is ANIMATION, the person engaging with their purpose, which is determined by their form and doing what they\nare supposed to be doing. As Aristotle said, if an axe had a soul it would be chopping; if an eye had a soul it would be\nseeing. We have a soul, and that is to engage with reason and live the good life.\n12",

From here, the soul moved the body around by way of directing the spirit through the ventricles and arteries and thus\noperating the body like some super marionette.\nDescartes chose the pineal gland as, in his time, it was believed that the pineal gland otherwise had no purpose in the brain,\nand secondly because, while the rest of the brain was divisible into two halves, everything from the left mirroring everything\non the right, the pineal gland appeared indivisible. In this way, Descartes was building an ANATOMICAL picture for the\noperations of the soul's interaction with the body.\nOne way of better understanding DESCARTES' view of the soul's interaction with the body is to compare it to the\ncardiovascular system (this is NOT an example given by Descartes).",

Darwin suggested that life forms undergo random mutations over millennia and that the mutations that better\nserve survival are the ones that remain.\nDarwin gave the example of the finches found on the Galapagos Islands. Darwin found many variations of finches each,\nwhich were perfectly adapted to their environments and food sources.

When he paints it,\nhe has it on the canvas and when he contemplates it now, the idea of the existing painting, compared to the idea of the\npaining before it was painted, is greater.\nConclusion: God must exist.

But if I were then told that this man did not exist, it would not affect my understanding of the\ndescription.\nConclusion: In the same way, I can understand what Anselm means by 'a being than which nothing greater can be\nconceived' without committing myself to believing it is a real thing.\nVersion 1 Premise 2: Gaunilo challenged the use of existence as a PREDICATE. He argued that one could not simply\ndefine God into existence by saying that God's perfection required God to exist.\nExample of the island: If I were to describe an island that were perfect in every way, I could well imagine it. But to be\ntold that now by virtue of the fact that I understood it to be perfect, I now must accept it exists in reality, is absurd.\nConclusion: Gaunilo was arguing that that existence DE DICTO (by definition) could not lead to existence DE RE (in\nreality). Ultimately, existence is not a predicate and so we cannot list it among God's attributes.\nAnselm's Apologetic: Anselm replied to Gaunilo by pointing out that it was impossible to compare God to an island as\nthe island is a CONTINGENT thing and God is a NECESSARY one.

Ultimately, God does not want people to\ngo to hell, however, if God is love and if humans have free will, then that love must be all encompassing and any human\nfreedom that seeks to reject it must lovingly be accepted. Therefore, God is bound by his own nature to allow for hell, the\nplace where people send themselves through their own rejection of God's love. Another way of thinking about hell is as C.

    "content": "i. Boethius\nAs part of Boethius's solution to the conflict between God's omniscience and human free will, Boethius, through the voice of\nLady Philosophy, sought to show that God's nature was eternal. By this, Boethius meant that God did not exist within the\nworld but completely apart from it. This echoes Augustine who said that God had to be TRANSCENDENT otherwise God\ncould not have been the creator of the world.\nHe gives the example of the man watching another man sitting. One places a necessity on the other. 'A' must be sitting if 'B'\nsees 'A' sitting. And 'B' must be watching 'A' sitting if 'A' is actually sitting. So if God sees beforehand what I do, then He\nnecessitates it. Lady Philosophy resolves this problem by identifying God's perspective as one of an ETERNAL God outside\ntime.\nLady philosophy suggested the problem was in human understanding of ETERNITY, rather than the problem of God's\nknowledge. Knowledge is dependent not on the subject, but the knower. In the same way that an adult can know a phone\nin a more sophisticated way to a baby, God can know us in a more sophisticated way than we know each other. She\npresented four spheres of knowledge: 1. Sensory, 2. Imaginative, 3. Rational, 4. Pure Intellectual. A knower of one sphere\ncan know the previous but never the next so we can never know subjects as God knows them. Additionally, Lady Philosophy\nsuggested that God's ETERNAL perspective means that He sees every event in history in a perfect present, not in temporal\nsequence but in an A-TEMPORAL PRESENT. So time does not pass for God, it is static. We experience time, God does\nnot. In this way, God can know all things without influencing them for human beings.\nii. Augustine and Aquinas\nAUGUSTINE discusses the problem of considering a 'time' before God since it was God who created time. Augustine sees\nGod's as transcendent, that is a-temporal and outside of space itself. So God's ETERNITY means that God is timeless. All\nquestions of God's nature must be considered from a non-spatiotemporal perspective. If God is outside of time, then God\ncannot change as change requires time. God is immutable which suggests that God wills from ETERNITY. There was never\na time when God changed what he wills. E.g. God must have willed the universe ETERNALLY.\nThis position was later reaffirmed by Aquinas who was heavily influenced by Boethius and Augustine. He repeats Boethius\nnotion that God sees everything in an ETERNAL simultaneous present. Aquinas sees God as the unmoved mover, uncaused\ncause. This can only make sense if God is an ETERNAL TRANSCENDENT being. From this position, God is timeless.\nAnthony KENNY criticises Aquinas with his challenge that if his own writings are simultaneous with ETERNITY as is\nRome's burning under Nero, then the writing of Kenny's paper takes place simultaneously as Nero's actions.

It was a variation of Boethius' view that\nGod exists timelessly; however, rather than placing God outside of time, Anselm placed God within all times - omni-present,\nin all times, all of the time. God is everywhere in every time and in every place, so God knows everything because God is\neverywhere. But God does not force action, because God is present everywhere in an OBSERVATIONAL sense, not a\ncontrolling sense.\nWhere Boethius and Aquinas describe God as seeing he whole road as though from a mountaintop, for Anselm, God is at\nevery point along the road, the start, middle and end, completely immersed in the world.",

Swinburne\nargued that for God to know what it is to be in the world in 1995, He needed to be in the world in 1995. This perspective\nalso makes sense in terms of how we build a relationship with God. If God is within the world, then we can pray to God and\nHe can answer. God can perform miracles and take an interest in our lives. If God is ETERNAL, then, as Boethius suggests,\nprayers are in vain as God cannot respond to them as God is immutable.\nSwinburne's position does have weaknesses. As Augustine suggested, if God created all things then time is one of those\nthings and God cannot be subject to time. Additionally, this limits God considerably as God is now subject to time. It raises\nquestions about how God could create the world if God is within the boundaries of the world and time.",

In this example, he suggests that the action (the man sitting) places\nNECESSITY on the observation (the other man watching). But in turn, the truth of the observation necessitates the reality\nof the action. When the action comes first, there is no problem, but when the observation comes first (as with Providence),\nthis destroys free will as human actions are necessitated by God's knowledge of them.\nThrough the voice of LADY PHILOSOPHY, Boethius resolves that in fact God's Providence exists eternally and so knows\neverything in its own present rather than in time before they happen. Providence looks forth rather than forward as though\nfrom a mountaintop. For this reason, Providence's Omniscient perspective does not interfere with human free will in any\nway, and so humans are free to act and pray to God.\n50",

But there is nothing to say\nabout it directly. Plotinus, the Neo Plotinus, identified the Essential FORM of Goodness with God, and so God takes on that\nabstraction.\nBOETHIUS, AUGUSTINE and Thomas AQUINAS all argued that God existed in a timeless eternity.

As shown in the\nstudy of Religious Experience, any direct revelation of God is ineffable to us.

God can better be understood through negation.\nMoses Maimonides gave an interesting example of how negation can accurately lead one to understanding a subject\nwithout any recourse to POSITIVE LANGUAGE. The example was of a ship and the method of emphasising the\nsuperiority of the VIA NEGATIVA was to play a form of 20 questions where, by process of elimination, a group of\nenquirers would eventually come to understand that the subject in question — a ship — as it was not a mineral, a solid, a\nsphere etc.\nn. Any attempt to use positive language would ultimately lead to loss of\nfaith.\nMaimonides' additional point has some merit to it. Consider the notions of Sigmund FREUD (obviously Maimonides did not\nconsider Freud as Freud lived 700 years after Maimonides), that we project our desire for an eternal father figure to create\nthe idea of God. By using POSITIVE LANGUAGE to describe God, we are using the language of human experience, and in\ndoing so, we are projecting our human desires onto an external figure. Indirectly, we are reducing God to a human construct\nand assigning anthropomorphic characteristics to Him. These characteristics would then be contradictory. Take for example\nthe quality of omnipotence. As previously shown, by seeing God's omnipotence as the ability to do anything as we\nunderstand it, we fall into problems: what it means, how we deal with suffering etc. In this way, we find ourselves doubting\nGod's existence, all because we used positive language.\n55",

However, since it is impossible for us to comprehend the ground of our being directly and personally,\nwe do so through SYMBOLS.

Tillich argued that society is what gives and what can take\naway the meaning of SYMBOLS. However, SYMBOLS cannot be destroyed; attempts to destroy SYMBOLS in a society\noften has the opposite effect of it becoming more powerful, e.g. the Christian ICHTHUS was used by Christians in the\nRoman times.

Version 1, Modification 1: Strong and Weak Verification\nStrong VERIFICATION - stating something using sense observation here and now. There is clear evidence for it and it can\nbe state conclusively.\nWeak VERIFICATION - statements confirmed though INDUCTIVE reasoning. It is probably the case based on past\nevidence and verification. We do not need to observe it in the strong sense, but if new observations change our ideas then\nthey are taken on board. We find that most scientific knowledge is weakly verified, e.g. that water boils at 100 degrees, that\nhumans are mortal etc.\nThis form of VERIFICATION still found criticism and challenge. Richard Swinburne argued that there are plenty of things\nthat cannot be VERIFIED even weakly that are meaningful to discuss, e.g. history, theoretical physics and quantum physics\netc. These cannot be verified even weakly and yet we discuss them as though they have meaning.\nii. Version 1, Modification 2: Verification in Practice and Principle\nVERIFICATION IN PRACTICE is like strong verification where it can be verified in the here and now and can be seen as\nconclusive.\nVERIFICATION IN PRINCIPLE is the verification where we accept the limitation of what we can practically verify,\nhowever, since we know how we would verify something that cannot be weakly verified, we are able to discuss it. For\nexample, even though I cannot see a quark or quantum strings I know the theory of how I would be able to verify them and\nso it is meaningful to discuss it. Furthermore, even though we have no proof of aliens, we know how we would verify them,\nby visiting all planets etc. Even though it is not practical, it is in principle possible and so it is verifiable.\nHowever, this led to HICK's challenge.

He called it a\nLEBENSFORM, a FORM OF LIFE. It is unique to the people engaging in the language and is meaningful to them. He\ndeveloped a theory that language was ever growing and adapting and it only makes sense in very specific contexts and as\nsuch could not be subject to verification. He gave the example of builders working on a site where they use terms such as\n'plank' and 'block'. When the foreman calls the term the workers know what he wants and brings it to him. This dialogue,\nWittgenstein argued, was an example of a primitive language, which is unique to builders.\nNormal MALCOLM supported the view of language as lebensform. He argued that all language is contextual and only\nmakes sense in their proper contexts. He further commented that atheists see religious language as an \"alien form of life\";\nhence, they do not understand how to engage with it.\n65",

    "content": "In the same way that chess has its own language and uses of terms, so does football and the two are distinct, therefore, to\nbe 'check mated' is meaningless in football, as much as being 'off-side' means nothing in chess. The terms make sense in\ntheir contexts but OBJECTIVELY they have no meaning.\nWittgenstein called the business of using language in its context a LANGUAGE GAME. He argued that the use of\nlanguage was not private but public within a community, and each language using community is different, e.g. the\ncommunity of English speakers, the community of chess players, the community of mathematicians. Language can only\nmake sense when it is used with other members of that language using community. In the community of theism, statements\nsuch as \"God is good\" make sense, but statements like \"F=MA\" mean nothing. The implication of this is that while it has\ncontextual meaning, language itself has no objective meaning, it is NON-COGNITIVE.\nIn separating different types of talk as different language games Wittgenstein removed the link between GOD-TALK and\nobjective truth. Thus, God-Talk is both redeemed by calling it a different language game, so atheists can no longer call it\nmeaningless, and also punished, as it suggests that you cannot make an objective empirical or historical statements about\nreligious ideas as they only have meaning in a \"religious context\".\nThis is a problem for believers who do not think that their God-Talk is nothing more than a secret language that they use to\nhelp understand each other. Religious believers are convinced that their language conveys truths about the objective\nuniverse. Language games does not allow this to be the case. It compartmentalises all language into its own game. While\nthere are crossovers, e.g. mathematical formulae (MATHS-TALK) being used in physics (SCIENCE-TALK) and discussion\nof Jesus Christ (CHRISTIANITY-TALK) coming from Nazareth (GEOGRAPHY-TALK), there is no cognitive truth to any\nlanguage. Language itself is made up.\nUltimately, Wittgenstein was arguing that God-Talk is meaningful to participants in the GOD-TALK LANGUAGE GAME,\nbut not to anyone not participating in the game.\n66",

    "title": "A. Falsification",
    "content": "i. Flew's Falsification\nAnthony FLEW argued that GOD-TALK was meaningless because it was UNFALSIFIABLE. By this, he meant that\nbelievers make their claims about God but do not accept any basis by which their claims might be refuted. By not accepting\nsuch refutations, believers make their claims UNFALSIFIABLE and so meaningless.\nFlew argued that when we make assertions we unconsciously refute the negation of that assertion, so if I assert 'my pen is\nblack' I am unconsciously asserting 'my pen is not red, blue, green or any other colour than black'. This way, I am allowing\nthat if it could be shown that my pen is green, it would refute my original assertion. If we do not allow any conditions for\nthe negation, then we are unconsciously omitting any conditions for the assertion itself. If I do not allow that my pen is\ncategorically NOT green, then should my pen be revealed to be green, I might deny that my original assertion was false by\nmodifying it to say: 'my pen is black, or green.' Thus my original assertion means nothing.\nFlew used John WISDOM's Parable of the EXPLORERS (and the Gardener) to emphasise his point; when two explorers\nhappen on a garden in a forest, one asserts \"there is a gardener\", but the second shows all evidence to the contrary.\nHowever, no evidence will shake the first's resolve and he maintains \"there is an intangible, invisible, inaudible gardener\".\nThe second declares: \"what remains of your original assertion?\" FLEW maintained that when believers are faced with\nevidence that contradicts their assertions, like \"God loves me\", or \"God has a plan\", they are so vague and void of any\nrefutations of negations, that the assertion \"dies a death of a thousand qualifications\" and becomes \"factually\nmeaning less\" .\nii. Popper's Falsification\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF FALSIFICATION is first brought to light by Karl POPPER in Conjectures and Refutations where he\nis responding to what he called pseudo-science, that is astrology and Freudian psychology. He argued that such disciplines\nmasquerade as science but are themselves not actual science as they fail the test of falsification and have no actual\nscientific basis.\nHe argued that if any claim was to be considered SCIENTIFIC, it must be in principle falsifiable. For example, if one were to\nclaim 'water boils at 100 degrees Celsius', they are claiming that it does not boil at 98, 99, 101, 102 etc. Should it be shown\nthat water boils at 101 degrees Celsius, then it shows the original assertion false, but still scientific as it was subject to\nfalsification. Science is the process of attempting to disprove assertions. If an assertion has no principle basis for\nfalsification, then it is not scientific. For example: 'your fortune will grow as Mars moves into Pisces' or 'men want to kill\ntheir fathers and marry their mothers'. Such assertions are not scientific as there is no principle basis for falsification. Popper\ncalled this the principle of demarcation between what is science and what is pseudo-science.\nFLEW takes this principle and assumes that it demarcates between what is meaningful and meaningless. But this is not\npresent in Popper's original thesis. To assume that falsificationism can demarcate between meaningful and meaningless\nlanguage is to change Popper's original thesis. This is what Flew appears to do. For Flew if a statement is not falsifiable, then,\nnot only is it not scientific, but it is not meaningful either.\n67",

Hare\nadmits that the student is a lunatic and that his assertion is indeed unfalsifiable. However, he maintains that it is still\nmeaningful to him. It affects his life, and he alone can control what counts as evidence.\nHare discussed what people really believe and think about things. He gives his own example of being utterly convinced that\nthe steering column in his car works. If he did not believe it, he would not drive. His blik that the steering column works\naffects his life as he drives his car. Were he to have any REASON to believe that it did not work, he would not drive.

He meets a stranger who impresses him greatly and is convinced that the\nstranger is an ally. When the stranger is seen helping friends the partisan declares \"see, he is on our side\", and when\nhe is seen helping the enemy, the partisan declares \"he must have a reason to behave that way\". This is a reflection\nof how believers INTERPRET good and bad events as though God is still good.\nMitchell warned that believers should not allow religious beliefs to be vacuous formulae, but that experience should\nin fact make a difference. For example, if I believe \"Thor makes the lightning\", what of all the evidence that shows\nthat lightning is a natural phenomenon? Will I deny the evidence to maintain my BLIND FAITH? Mitchell argues\nthat we should not do that. In this way, falsification does help to demarcate between what is meaningful and what is\nmeaningless, though not to the extent that Flew does.\n• TOYS IN THE CUPBOARD: Richard Swinburne present the idea that we can talk meaningfully about toys in a\ncupboard that come alive when no-one is watching.

You could be a\nDarwinian atheist and believe in natural law derived by empirical observation, with the primary precept of survival (Aquinas'\npreservation of life). Richard DAWKINS (The Selfish Gene) goes so far as to argue for a natural genetic tendency to be\naltruistic: a lust to be nice. \"The theory of Natural Law suggests..morality is autonomous. It has its own questions, its own\nmethods of answering them, and its own standards of truth, and religious considerations are not the point\". Rachels (2006:56)\nAN EXALTED VIEW OF HUMAN BEINGS: We use reason to work out how to live. So we are not slaves to our passions\nor our genes. Natural Law has a purpose: a flourishing society and a person fulfilled and happy - EUDAIMONIA. It is not\nultimately about restricting us by rules, but setting us free to fulfil our proper purpose or TELOS, inherent in our design: to\nrationally assent to personal growth. If we can agree on our purpose we can agree on what morality is for. Moreover, we\ndon't have to accept the fact/value division inherent in Moore or Ayer's philosophy. \"The natural world is not to be regarded\nmerely as a realm of facts, devoid of value or purpose. Instead, the world is conceived to be a rational order with value and\npurpose built into its very nature\". James Rachels (2006: 50)\nFLEXIBLE: Natural Law is not inflexible. The primary precepts may be general and unchanging, but as Aquinas argued,\nSECONDARY PRECEPTS can change depending on circumstances, culture and worldview. Aquinas calls them 'proximate\nconclusions of reason'. The Doctrine of DOUBLE EFFECT is also a way to escape the moral dilemmas which exist when\ntwo rules conflict, (See Louis Pojman 2006: 47-51) — so not as ABSOLUTE as textbooks suggest.\n78",

(40\nmarks)\nA01 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding through the use of some of the following material. (Maximum 16 marks)\n. Natural law is a TELEOLOGICAL theory (with deontological aspects — see below) arising from the Greek worldview\nthat everything has a purpose (telos). Aristotle begins his Ethics by arguing that humans have a rational purpose to\nlive well and to flourish. The ultimate purpose is EUDAIMONIA — which can be translated 'happiness' but is better\ntranslated as 'a flourishing life'.\n. Our purpose is dependent on our rational human natures. We can observe a posteriori (from experience) the purposes\nhuman beings naturally pursue. These include preservation of life, living in an ordered society, worship of God,\neducation and reproduction (acronym POWER).\n. Aquinas adapts the Aristotelean Greek worldview and links it to the higher law of God, which Aquinas calls the\nETERNAL LAW. This is the divine blueprint for the world revealed in nature more generally (and is the incentive for\nChristians to study science to think God's thoughts after Him). The four laws give the Natural Law a deontological\naspect (where deontology means knowledge of laws and duties). From the eternal law God reveals in divine law (the\nBible) and natural law (in our human natures). We then use our reason to work out and enact human law.\nSYNOPTIC LINK to KANT's inaccessible realm of true reality or PLATO's FORMS.\n. Inherent in our natures is a form of knowledge Aquinas calls SYNDERESIS. This is a general knowledge of good and\nevil reflected in our desire to follow morally good ends which are called the primary precepts (acronym POWER\nabove). This is not dependent on our belief in God: it is a general gift to all human beings and gives the natural law its\nUNIVERSAL nature (applicable to all people at any time, place or any era).\n. Secondary precepts are the outworking of the general principles (primary precepts) given by our innate synderesis.\nAquinas is clear that these are not absolute: they may change as our human reason encounters new insights or new\ndifficulties. For example, Aquinas introduces the concept of DOUBLE EFFECT in relation to killing: it's okay to kill (a\nmoral wrong) in self-defence (a moral right). In such cases of moral conflict we again use our reason (reflecting our\nrational natures).\nA02 Demonstrate evaluation and analysis through the use of some of the following arguments (maximum 24 marks)\n.

Discuss\nA01 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding through the use of some of the following material. (Maximum 16 marks)\n. There are three distinctive features of Kantian ethics — each needs to be explained. It is DEONTOLOGICAL, NON-\nCONSEQUENTIALIST and ABSOLUTE.\n. Deontological means 'duty-based'. Kantian duties arise from the three formulations of the CATEGORICAL\nIMPERATIVE and his emphasis on motive — 'duty for duty's sake'. In contrast to utilitarians, Kant emphasises that\nour motive needs to be pure and not guided by self-interest — we act out of wonder and love for the moral law, \"two\nthings fill me with wonder, the starry hosts above and the moral law within\".\n. Kant asks us to make a leap of the imagination and imagine a world where everyone acted according to the\ncategorical imperative (categorical here means 'absolute', 'unconditional'). You will only have time to discuss two of\nthe three formulations (see back).\n. The first formula states we should so act as to will 'the maxim of our action as a universal law for the whole of\nhumanity'. Imagine a world where everyone didn't lie for example. This world would be a better place, argues Kant.\nThere is an element of abstraction here — but is Kant's formula too abstract to be useful? We discuss this later.\n. The second formula states we should 'never treat people simply as a means to an end but always also as an end in\nthemselves'. This means, categorically and unconditionally, we should always treat people with absolute DIGNITY\nand respect as if we were that person ourselves. Professor Norman helpfully remind us to 'universalise our shared\nhumanity'.\n. So Kant asks us to focus on people as an end in themselves and not treat people as a means to our own, or the\nnation's, happiness. We never sacrifice one person to meet the interests of the group or treat people pragmatically:\nthey have absolute rights and we have absolute DUTIES to preserve those rights.

Is this categorical of no practical use as the essay title suggests? \"There is more to the moral point of view than being\nwilling to universalise one's rules\" suggests William FRANKENA. This 'more things' are our feelings — in the above\nexample our feelings of loyalty to our friend. If we tell the truth he or she gets into trouble — it's a case of a conflict of\ntwo moral 'goods' and Kant asks us to choose the one we are highly unlikely to opt for.

Discuss (40 marks)\nA01 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding through the use of some of the following material. (Maximum 16 marks)\n. The specification doesn't specify any particular version of utilitarianism, so you need to clarify which one you're\ntaking: for example, Bentham 's HEDONIC act utilitarianism and Mill's RULE UTILITARIAN versions would give\nvery different answers.\n. Mill was aware of the major criticism of utilitarianism produced, for example, by Thomas Carlyle, that it was a\npleasure-based swinish philosophy, as like pigs we snuffled around in a world of PLEASURE; that it sacrificed the\ninnocent to please the majority and so was unjust and finally, that it failed to develop moral character.\n. According to Bentham, the only thing that matters is that we maximise pleasure and minimise pain. Even our natural\nsympathies for any innocent victim must be set aside. We make a cold-hearted calculation of likely\nCONSEQUENCES, based on the EQUALITY PRINCIPLE: \"everyone to count as one, no-one as more than one\".\n. Mill rejects this argument for sacrificing the innocent if necessary. His sixth chapter argues for SOCIAL UTILITY -\nthat we need to guarantee basic rights and have just procedures as a foundation for personal happiness. Try living in\nan anarchic society, says Mill, and you will immediately recognise that social utility is a key to utilitarianism.\n. So Mill arguably avoids this charge of immoral outcomes by having two levels of utilitarian ethics: generally we\nfollow social rules laid down by past wisdom and experience which we know guarantee utility, then if two moral\ngoods conflict, we revert to make an ACT UTILITARIAN decision. We call this WEAK RULE UTILITARIANISM\nbecause the rules are breakable, not hard rules like in KANTIAN ETHICS.\nA02 Demonstrate Analysis and Evaluation (24 marks)\n. BERNARD WILLIAMS argues for an INTEGRITY OBJECTION to utilitarianism because, citing an example of JIM\nand the INDIANS, the decision to kill an innocent human being is something most of us just could not do - it violates\nour sense of who we really are (a moral being). See quotes section below.\n. JL MACKIE argues that utilitarianism brings ethics generally into disrepute because of the PRACTICALITY\nPROBLEM. It forces us to make calculations of future consequences without providing the means of getting the\nWISDOM to do this well. Because we find this impossible, moral thinking generally is brought into disrepute (as we\nfind in the IRAQ war, for example - which isn't Mackie's example, but shows how a prime minister's reputation can\nbe lost).\n. But arguably Mill's version of utilitarianism avoids both objections. The INTEGRITY objection is avoided because Mill\nargues for the utilitarian benefit of EDUCATION and building MORAL CHARACTER with virtues such as\ngenerosity and sympathy. His ethics is closer to ARISTOTLE than BENTHAM because Mill's happiness is closer to\nAristotle's idea of personal and social EUDAIMONIA.\n97",

The HOSPICE movement may be seen as an alternative, BUT this level of care is not\navailable to everyone, is expensive and cannot fully relieve a patient's suffering (eg for someone who cannot breathe\nunassisted).\nVOLUNTARY AND COMPETENT — some raise questions about voluntary euthanasia. Can the patient ever be free from\ncoercion (eg relatives who want an inheritance or doctors who need to free up resources)? Is the patient likely to be\ncompetent (eg when under high doses of medication, or when depressed, or senile). Response would be that there are at\nleast some clear cases when patients ARE clearly voluntary (not coerced) and competent. Guidelines such as Starmer's or\nthe OREGON RULES require a certain time period of repeated requests to different people, which are then independently\nconfirmed.\nSLIPPERY SLOPE — this is the argument that once allowed, the outcome will be a process of a further decline in respect\nfor human life and will end with the practice of non-voluntary euthanasia for the elderly seen as \"unaffordable\" by the\nworking majority. A response might be that there is a clear difference between voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia. Is\nthere any evidence of a slippery slope in the US state of Oregon or Switzerland? The rules on assisted suicide are drawn up\nprecisely to stop the slide into widespread disrespect for human life. Note this is an EMPIRICAL, CONSEQUENTIALIST\nargument about probabilities.\nDOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP — some argue that doctors have a duty to preserve life (the HIPPOCRATIC OATH).\nEuthanasia will undermine the trust between patient and doctor if there is a fear that they will seek to end their life.\nHowever, as with abortion, there will remain doctors opposed to euthanasia which a patient could always choose, and it is\nhighly unlikely that GPs will have any say in the process of mercy killing.",

Discuss\nA01 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding through the use of some of the following material. (Maximum 16 marks)\n• ACTIVE EUTHANASIA means actively administering a drug (either oneself or an assistant) to hasten death, and is\ngenerally held to be morally unacceptable. Passive euthanasia means withholding treatment and is generally held to\nbe morally acceptable. In countries such as the Netherlands test cases continue to define the parameters of legal\neuthanasia: for example, whether a living will choosing death can be carried out after someone gets dementia. This\nwas confirmed as legal in test case in 2019.\n. A doctor who slipped a sedative in an Alzheimer's patient's coffee before administering a lethal drug was acquitted of\nbreaking Dutch euthanasia laws because a LIVING WILL had confirmed consent some years before. Dutch law\nrequires consent 'earnestly and with full conviction\" — the judge rules \"We believe that given the deeply demented\ncondition of the patient the doctor did not need to verify her wish for euthanasia.\"\n• Euthanasia breaks the HIPPOCRATIC OATH that all doctors take: \"I will not prescribe a deadly drug to please\nsomeone, nor give advice that may cause his death\". Some argue that breaking this covenant between doctor and\npatient fundamentally alters the perception of the medical profession.\n. Moral factors include the balance of harm and benefit to the patient, the issue of patient choice, the wider social and\nfamily context, and the motive of the person involved in the act of euthanasia. Others (such as Lord Alton) argue that\na SLIPPERY SLOPE will emerge whereby vulnerable people are pressurised to choose death.\n• The idea of voluntary euthanasia is problematic because pain distorts our VISION OF LIFE and people who are\nchronically ill may feel hopeless and depressed even when cures may remain possible. Daniel James chose to die in\n2008 when a rugby injury left him paralysed even though many argued that he might have led a fulfilling life.\n• James RACHELS produces a case to try establish that there is no moral difference. Someone lets a child who has\nslipped in the bathtub drown in order to inherit his money (letting die), and someone who will push a child down in\nthe water to drown him in order to inherit his money (killing).) He concludes: \"active euthanasia is not any worse than\npassive euthanasia\". His argument is that since the outcome is the same and both acts lead to a patient's death, there\nis no difference between active and passive euthanasia in terms of the moral aspect.\n.

    "content": "Developing a point made by David Hume, philosophers like GE MOORE have argued that when we move from a\ndescription about the real world to a moral statement we make a leap from a naturalistic statement to a PRESCRIPTIVE\nstatement (one with ought in it). This prescription is doing something different. What we often fail to do is explain the\nmissing link between a description and a prescription - and this leap from is to ought is what is known as the\nNATURALISTIC FALLACY. A.N. Prior (1949) explains the fallacy:\n\"Because some quality invariably accompanies the quality of goodness, this quality is identical with goodness. If, for\nexample, it is believed that whatever is pleasant is good, or that whatever is good must be pleasant, or both, it is\ncommitting the naturalistic fallacy to infer from this that goodness and pleasantness are the same quality. The\nnaturalistic fallacy is the assumption that because the words 'good' and 'pleasant' necessarily describe the same objects,\nthey must attribute the same quality to them\". AN Prior (1949)\nMOORE argued that goodness cannot be a COMPLEX analysable property of an action. For example a horse can be\nbroken down into animal, mammal, four legs, hairy tail — a COMPLEX idea. Because goodness isn't a complex idea, it must\nbe either a SIMPLE, indefinable quality or it doesn't refer to anything at all. Since ethics isn't an ILLUSION, goodness\nmust consist in a simple INDEFINABLE QUALITY, like the colour yellow.",

The open question attack suggests I can always ask the question \"it produces pleasure, but\nnonetheless, is it morally GOOD?\"\nIf I can answer \"no\" to this point then I have proved that goodness is something independent of pleasure.\nMoore's Intuitionism\nMoore was a non-naturalist COGNITIVIST because he believed that goodness could not be defined by its natural\nproperties, but that we know what we mean by good by a special intuition or perception (so COGNITIVIST, as goodness\ncan be known as a shared experience).\nMoore argues goodness is an INDEFINABLE PROPERTY of an action just as the colour yellow is a non-definable\nproperty of a lemon - we know what it is and that's the end of it. We can try and reduce yellowness to light waves but that\ndoesn't precisely tell us what yellow is - yellow just is yellow, we know this by intuition.

John Maynard KEYNES once commented that\n\"Moore could not distinguish love, and beauty and truth from the furniture\", so enraptured was he by his idealised world of\nthe forms.\nMoore also confuses a complex thing (colour) for a simple thing (yellow). Goodness is in fact a COMPLEX idea, like\nCOLOUR because it includes within it a whole class of principles we might describe as good (like colour includes, red,\nyellow, green, blue).\nMoore has confused a general category (colour, goodness) for a specific quality of that category (yellowness, generosity).",

That which maximises happiness and minimises pain is good,\nand actions that do the opposite are bad.\nUtilitarians quite openly commit the NATURALISTIC FALLACY (which they argue isn't a fallacy at all) arguing that it is\nobviously good to pursue happiness because that as a matter of fact is the goal that all humans are pursuing. They give a\nTELEOLOGICAL justification for goodness, just as NATURAL LAW theorists such as AQUINAS follow Aristotle in linking\ngoodness to HUMAN FLOURISHING.\nThe philosopher JOHN SEARLE gives us another naturalist way out of the supposed fallacy.

MACKIE (Inventing Right and Wrong,1977) argues that the common view of moral language implies that there are\nsome objective moral facts in the universe. But this view is a MISTAKE. There are no moral facts. We can only base our\nmoral judgements on FEELINGS and DESIRES.\nThe INTUITIONISTS (G.E. Moore, H.A. Prichard, W.D.

Fully explain and work out the implications of the words 'origin' and 'meaning'. The debate is over whether ethical\nstatements have their origin 'out there' in some OBJECTIVE meaningful way. Naturalists such as natural law\ntheorists (or utilitarians) claim there is some objective, measurable, observable basis to ethical statements. Explain\nwhat this basis is.\n. Intuitionists such as GE MOORE argue for a non-measurable, indefinable, SIMPLE, irreducible property of moral\ngoodness which originates in an intuition. This is a form of perception — we 'see' goodness much as we 'see' the\ncolour 'yellow'. But we cannot say anything more — goodness just is goodness, something we know intuitively. You\nmight note how this is similar to the claim of Aquinas that goodness is something innate, known by 'synderesis' — a\nGod-given faculty of intuition.\n. AJ AYER argues there is no such thing as a moral FACT. What moral language does is express approval or disapproval,\nrather like spray painting a colour over a piece of furniture. The fact (chair) doesn't change - but we express an\nattitude towards it, like saying Yuk! (disapproval) or Hooray! (approval).\n. The origin of ethical statements lies in our ATTITUDE (which may be influenced by society, friends, etc) and expresses\nitself through our feelings (hence emotivism). It does not lie in any fact out there in the world (no OBJECTIVE basis).\nA02 Analysis and evaluation (24 marks)\n. Even if we agree with naturalists like Aquinas or Mill, they might be criticised for assuming it is easy to measure or\nobserve this NATURAL GOODNESS inherent in our behaviour or in or feelings of pleasure or pain. As GE Moore\nobserved - just because it is pleasurable doesn't make something good (drug taking may be pleasurable but it isn't\ngood) — this is called the open question argument because we can always ask an open question \"X may be\npleasurable but is it good?', implying pleasure and goodness are independent of each other.\n. Moore's argument however is also open to the OPEN QUESTION attack. \"It may be your intuition that genocide is\ngood, but is it really good?\". Also Moore implies goodness is a simple (single) property like 'yellow', but in practice it\nseems to be a complex property (like colour) with many facets (justice, truth, generosity, beauty etc).\n. To claim an intuition is responsible for our moral sense begs the question 'where does it come from?\". To say 'it\ncomes from God' also begs the question — why do some people have bad or flawed moral intuitions?' FREUD\nindicated our moral sense comes from parental praise and blame in early childhood and can be very flawed — leading\nto irrational and pathological guilt feelings and mental illness.\n. AYER's emotivism can be criticised as SUBJECTIVE as he implies moral judgements are entirely 'up to me'; and as\nREDUCTIONIST as he implies moral language is just like ordinary language of observation of things, whereas\nHARE's PRESCRIPTIVISM argues moral language is of a unique type (prescriptive). It seems we do point to things\noutside ourselves (for example, suffering) in attributing evil to actions and goodness to others.\n125",

The pain of experience propels us towards change but can arise out of\nREPRESSION of urges which become unconscious.\nThe sense of self begins in childhood with an IDENTIFICATION with either FATHER or MOTHER. The origins of the\nrelationship with the MOTHER are explained by the OEDIPUS COMPLEX and with the FATHER by a process by which\nthe father (AUTHORITY FIGURE) becomes part of the infantile stage of the SUPEREGO.\nCARL JUNG also proposed an ELECTRA COMPLEX in 1913 to explain a girl's psychosexual competition with her mother\nfor possession of her father.\nThe EGO thus assumes a regulatory role - it excludes feelings and memories which don't fit our idea of self. For example,\nthis repression resurfaces in DREAMS and also PHOBIAS — a fear of spiders, for example, which reflect unconscious\nsources of anxiety. Freud believed the EGO was striving to be moral.\nThe role of PSYCHOANALYSIS is to seek to integrate the \"coherent ego and the repressed self which is split off from\nit\" (Freud).\nOur behaviour (ACTION) is a product of both conscious choices and UNCONSCIOUS forces 'which exert a driving force\nwithout the EGO noticing the compulsion\" (Freud). These forces result in behaviour which are driven by a complex\nPSYCHIC ENERGY which can leave the human being baffled and confused by their own behaviour — resulting in a feeling\nof ANXIETY or GUILT, and DEPRESSION (which Freud called 'melancholia').",

A sense of dread\nemerges in childhood from a fear of castration, a fear of death and a fear of SEPARATION from our parents, particularly a\nfear of loss of the mother's love. The superego can have a destructive power: causing the EGO to feel deserted and unloved,\nabandoned to an anxious and uncertain world and 'fuelling the death-instinct by making the Ego feel abandoned'. This\nsense of abandonment and powerlessness resurfaces in DREAMS (often of failure or of loss of control).\nSo the SUPEREGO can have both a POSITIVE and a NEGATIVE role — positive in controlling unbridled and anti-social\ndesires and passions, but also NEGATIVE in forming an extreme critical voice \"brutally chastising and punishing\" with\nguilt, or shame and ultimately a sense of SELF-HATRED which cause self-harm and depression.\nWe can also experience the SUPEREGO as SAVIOUR and project our guilt and shame onto a sense of SIN and a\nFATHER-FIGURE — whom we call GOD, who replaces lost love and provides a SUBLIMINATION of our sexual desires.\nChristianity teaches that we deserve death, but that our place is taken by a substitute, Jesus Christ, who removes the GUILT\nand takes on himself the PUNISHMENT. (Isaiah 53 \"the punishment that makes us whole is upon him\"). The SUPEREGO\nin this way grows into a life and power of its own irrespective of the rational thought and reflection of the individual: it is\nprogrammed into us by the reactions of other people.\nThis 'superego', conscience, restricts humans' aggressive powerful desires (THANATOS within the ID) which would\notherwise DESTROY us. So guilt \"expresses itself in the need for punishment\" (Civilisation and its Discontents\n1930:315-6). ERIC FROMM, quoting Nietzsche, agrees with Freud's analysis of the destructive nature of the\nAUTHORITARIAN conscience.\n\"Freud has convincingly demonstrated the correctness of Nietzsche's thesis that the blockage of freedom turns man's\ninstincts 'backward against man himself'. Enmity, cruelty, the delight in persecution...- the turning of all these instincts\nagainst their own possessors: this is the origin of the bad conscience\".

The EGO deepens its relationship with the ID in rituals which may be associated with shame,\nsuch as masturbation, and fantasies that produce guilt. So the LIBIDO can be redirected or even suppressed altogether in a\nsublimation which we call RELIGION.\nUltimately, to Freud, Religion is an infantile projection of our desires and longings onto an image which is an ILLUSION.

In order to explain how, for example, Adolf EICHMANN can plead at his trial\nfor mass murder in 1961 that he was only \"following orders\" in applying the final solution, we can invoke Fromm's idea of\nthe authoritarian conscience.\nThe authoritarian conscience is the INTERNALISED VOICE of the external authority, something close to Freud's concept\nof the superego considered above. It's backed up by fear of punishment, or spurred on by admiration or can even be created\nbecause I idolise an authority figure, as Unity MITFORD did Adolf Hitler.\nAs Unity found, this blinds us to the faults of the idolised figure, and causes us to become SUBJECT to that person's will, so\nthat \"the laws and sanctions of the externalised authority become part of oneself\" (1947:108).\nSo, as with the Nazis, ordinary seemingly civilised human beings do ATROCIOUS EVIL because they are subject to a voice\nwhich comes essentially from outside them, bypassing their own moral sense. This authoritarian conscience can come from:\nPROJECTION onto someone of an image of perfection.\nThe experience of parental RULES or expectations.\nAn adopted BELIEF system, such as a religion, with its own authority structure.\n\"Good conscience is consciousness of pleasing authority, guilty conscience is consciousness of displeasing it\".

Aquinas argues the origin of conscience is God-given, innate (something we're born with) and intuitive (operating like\nan instinct). The word he uses is SYNDERESIS for this inbuilt intuitive knowledge of the primary precepts — a natural\norientation towards good, rational ends.\n.

The implies conscience may be flawed and even pathological — leading to irrational guilt and neurosis\n(particularly concerning sexual feelings, orientations and practices).\n. Aquinas argues that conscience operates by taking our God-given INTUITIONS and then applying reason. He calls\nthis second element conscientia — \"reason making right decisions\". We can link this to the creation and application of\nSECONDARY PRECEPTS which he calls 'approximate conclusions' of right judgement. Notice that this judgement is\nnot infallible, and the conclusions can change. As creatures made 'in the image of God' we are required to think.\n. FREUD argues that our feelings of guilt guide our actions. Although the mature conscience may later brand these\nfeelings 'irrational' nonetheless we are left with feelings of guilt which can be crippling if we break parent-induced\nnorms of behaviour. Sometimes we will need therapy to cure these, and the repressed feelings may surface in dreams\nwhich will need interpreting.\n.

And if I choose to be promiscuous that affects every person I am promiscuous with.\n. \"Sexual behaviour is natural and doesn't do anyone any harm\". This is a misunderstanding of what 'natural' means in\nethics. For example, the word 'natural\" in NATURAL LAW means 'in line with our rational natural purpose'. Certain\ngoals are unique to human beings - for example WORSHIP OF GOD and even those shared with animals\n(REPRODUCTION) function in a different way to animals - we are MORAL beings capable of evaluating\nconsequences, for example, and capable of understanding our social responsibility to build an orderly and co-\noperative society.\n. \"There is one heterosexual human nature\". This is an ASSUMPTION of natural law theory which appears highly\nquestionable. It seems there really is a HOMOSEXUAL human nature and also a TRANSGENDER human nature.\nThe whole ethics of sexual behaviour has altered radically in the light of empirical research (such as the KINSEY\nreport) and also the insights of psychologists such as FREUD and JUNG.

Feminist theologians like MARY DALY (see\nFEMINIST THEOLOGY section) find this evidence of PATRIARCHY (male power and domination).\n• Explain what the theology of the Fall implies: Human beings are made in the IMAGE of God, but the image is\ndistorted by human rebellion, selfishness and sin so \"we do not do what we want\" (Paul, Romans 7). There is a\nPARADOX (apparent contradiction) here between SYNDERESIS (inbuilt capacity to do good and avoid evil - see\nNATURAL LAW) and fallen, sinful human nature.

Later, AMBROSE (340-397), the 4th century bishop of Milan,\nemphasised that Christ had to be born to a virgin in order to remain free from sin because it passed through sexual\nrelations.\n• Peter BROWN's book, The Body and Society: Men, Women, and Sexual Renunciation in Early Christianity, illuminates\nhow Augustine saw nothing inherently wrong with sex or reproduction. The sexual instinct is corrupt because it\nclashed with the will of God. For Augustine, \"the uncontrollable elements in sexual desire revealed the working in the\nhuman person of a carnal lust, of a permanent flaw in the soul that tilted it irrevocably towards the flesh.\" (Brown, pg.\n418)\n• Alister McGRATH challenges the Dawkins worldview that \"genes are in you and me; they created us, body and mind;\nand their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence. This passage presents a completely defensible scientific\ncomment—'genes are in you and me'—with a series of equally indefensible metaphysical assertions\" (Surprised by\nMeaning, p. 36). Our fallen, sinful condition is amply evidenced by human history, with its examples of war, hatred,\nevil, and cruelty, argues McGrath, and the Fall is part of the intelligible (if unprovable) 'framework of faith'.\n• Your conclusion needs to consider what 'convincing' means, and to whom. The Fall is unconvincing to Richard\nDAWKINS or Mary DALY but for different reasons. However, to McGRATH it is the bedrock of a thoroughly\nconvincing Christian worldview, but one that has to be accepted by faith.\n160",

For example, you could say 'to some extent' but he was also a political liberator\nand according to the faith position, demonstrated himself to be a unique Son of God. Or you might argue Jesus was\njust a teacher of wisdom whose status was elevated by the early church. Make a decision.\n• You could develop the views of either EP Sanders (Jesus was not unique but something like a radical desert preacher\nsimilar to the community of the ESSENES), or SG BRANDON (Jesus was a political zealot), or BULTMANN (divine\nclaims and miraculous stories need to be demythologised). Make sure you develop and critically analyse such views.\n• You might examine the Biblical evidence. According to Mark, Jesus makes strong claims to divinity such as the answer\nto his accusers' question - are you the Son of God? Jesus invokes the divine name of YAHWEH when he says 'I am!'\nand promises divine revenge on his enemies.\n• You could discuss different interpretations of Jesus' teachings and also of his miracles: are they SIGNS of a redeemer\nand creator come to earth, or just stories with a moral message? Calming the storm (MARK 6) compared with\nhealing the paralysed man (MARK 2).\n• Consider the RESURRECTION. Is this another myth or final proof in history that Jesus was the INCARNATE God?\nDiscuss the issues of the Christ of FAITH versus the Christ of HISTORY.\nA02 Analysis and evaluation (24 marks)\n• Remember to keep your THESIS statement clear as it's easy to wander around this type of question and fail to\nanswer it properly. It doesn't matter what angle you take but how you substantiate it.\n• Select your scholars and make sure you EVALUATE their views. For example, BULTMANN writes from an\nENLIGHTENMENT perspective that miracles cannot literally happen.\n• BRANDON seems to overplay the zealot point: Judas was a zealot and opposed Jesus and Jesus himself seems to\noppose violence (with the exception of the TEMPLE incident). Pre-prepare your case around whichever scholars you\nwish to discuss.\n• Handle the Christ of FAITH versus Christ of HISTORY with care. After all, Jesus is attested as historical by\nJOSEPHUS, and the rapid emergence of the Christian church is evidence itself - with a doctrine heavily based on the\nCROSS and RESURRECTION as historical (read Paul, 1 CORINTHIANS 15).\n• Synoptic links can be made here to the LIBERATION THEOLOGIANS (Restrepo, Gutierrez, Cone, Boff) and also\nFEMINIST HERMENEUTICS (interpretation) because we need to adopt what RICOEUR calls a hermeneutics of\nsuspicion - that all our interpretations are captured to some extent by our worldview.\n188",

    "content": "Assess the view that the Bible is the comprehensive moral guide for\nChristians.\nA01 Knowledge and Understanding (16 marks)\n• The issues underpinning the question need to be made clear: is the Bible sufficient as an AUTONOMOUS (self-\nevident) source of Ethics, or is Christian ethics inevitably HETERONOMOUS (with several sources such as Church\ntradition and reason). Can the sources include MARXISM as LIBERATION THEOLOGIANS might argue? Note: be\ncareful how you use AUTONOMOUS as it could mean \"ethics is self-evident from human reason\".\n• Consider the view of KARL BARTH who argued that scripture has high value, but literalism could be dangerous as it\ngives the bible a divine status that can only rightly be given to God. This is BIBLIOLATRY — false worship of the\nBible. Link with 2 Timothy 3:16 \"All Scripture is inspired by God\".\n• Explore the idea of AUTONOMY as discussed by Hans KUNG There is nothing in Christian ethics that could not be\nfound in any person with good will. For example, the GOLDEN RULE is present in all major world religions in some\nform and closely resembles KANT's first formula of the CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE.\n• Contrast this view with BIBLICISTS who argue the Bible is inerrant and infallible. See the CHICAGO STATEMENT\non Biblical Inerrancy (1976) - but are they consistent eg in rejecting literalism of stoning adulterers yet maintaining\nthe world was created in six days?\n• Consider whether the Bible can exist outside of an INTERPRETATIVE COMMUNITY (the Church) and whether the\nRoman Catholic view that Reason, Scripture and tradition work together isn't more plausible.\n• BULTMANN and TILLICH both argue that NORMS are the key rather than laws or rules. LOVE, JUSTICE, can be\nlinked synoptically with FLETCHER's SITUATION ETHICS.\nA02 Analysis and Evaluation (24 marks)\n• Consider the limitations on Biblical guidance. Bible says nothing specifically about ABORTION, EUTHANASIA,\nCONTRACEPTION or GAY MARRIAGE. Protestants and Catholics take widely differing views on these issues.\n• The Church often appears to follow changes in social attitudes eg sexual behaviour rather than adopt a PROPHETIC\nROLE. Feminist theologians such as MARY DALY argue the Church's interpretation is consistently PATRIARCHAL\n(taking a male, authoritarian line and neglecting justice).\n• REASON following more recent understanding of BIOLOGY suggest that women cannot be 'misbegotten males' as\nAQUINAS argued. Aquinas also argued men would never take advice from emotional women. EQUALITY has\nbecome a principle of JUSTICE following REASON not Scripture.\n• PARABLES may be seen as key source of Christian Ethics. Yet they seem to be interpreted culturally. Example, the\nfeeding of the FIVE THOUSAND could be seen as a demand for more just distribution. Jesus says \"You feed them\".\n198",

The meaning of Christianity is in action.\nBARTH - we do not know God — it is God who chooses to REVEAL Himself to humans — always a special and never a\ngeneral act. BONHOEFFER agrees but says we should be careful not to accept the limited role of 'passively receiving'\nrevelation — we must 'do' as well as 'hear' the law - e.g. PHARISEES (a subdivision of Jewish religious teaches) listened to\ncommands but did not act on God's behalf; and in Luke, Martha acts but fails to listen to Jesus' teaching.

Human culture causes\ndifferences in beliefs and practices, but religions share the same ultimate goal.\nKANT — there is a difference between the NOUMENAL WORLD (world as it really is) and the PHENOMENAL WORLD\n(world as it appears to us). Nature of God belongs to the noumenal world (similar to PLATO's FORMS).\nJOHN HICK — called for a 'COPERNICAN REVOLUTION' in theology: to put God central — not Christianity. This call\nAWAY FROM a CHRISTOCENTRIC approach to theology is driven by our observations of the world, just as the\nCOSMOLOGICAL COPERNICAN REVOLUTION was.\nReligion is a PHENOMENAL attempt to understand God (by experience). All religions fall short of the truth. Christianity's\n'truth claims' e.g. Virgin Birth, should be understood as myths expressing human relationship with 'the REAL'. God is\nBENEVOLENT and so salvation must be extended to all.\nHick's call for DEMYTHOLOGIZATION of the Bible has origins in RUDOLF BULTMANN. This is the idea that the\nGospels do contain essential truths but these are revealed through MYTHS.\nHick argues it is impossible to create rational arguments for God e.g. NATURAL THEOLOGY. People are given reason to\nbelieve by RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCES. Knowledge of God is similar to our other knowledge of the world — through our\nexperiences. Since individual experiences provide the grounding for belief, we must respect all religions, since none of them\ncan provide universally-accepted argument for their beliefs. Experiences of God can be interpreted through the lens of\ndifferent religions and faith is how we interpret these events. An ANALOGY is how different people respond differently to\nthe same MUSICAL STIMULUS, influenced by their cultural background. Cultural influences might explain the differences\nin how people interpret the divine. Human projection shapes the experience but does not cause it.\n\"Hick proposes his pluralistic hypothesis in which each world faith is viewed as a separate culturally conditioned way in\nwhich the Ultimate Reality can be experienced.\" (David Kramer, Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy)",

Exclusivism can take different forms, so distinguish between OPEN and CLOSED exclusivisms.\n• Catholics believe there is no salvation outside of the Church — EXTRA ECCLESIAM NULLA SALUS. The Catholic\nview less narrow since LUMEN GENTIUM — \"many elements of sanctification and of truth are found outside of its\nvisible structure\" (1964).\n• EVANGELICAL Christians follow CALVIN and LUTHER - only through Scripture can we gain knowledge of God\nand the Bible implies Jesus is 'the way the truth and the life\" (JOHN 1). Jesus said 'no-one comes to the Father\nexcept through me' (JOHN 14:6).\n• Explain John HICK's PLURALISM - that there is one DIVINE REALITY reflected in all faiths. People are given\nreason to believe by RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCES. Experiences of God can be interpreted through the lens of\ndifferent religions and faith is how we interpret these events. This is INCLUSIVIST.\n• An ANALOGY is how different people respond differently to the same MUSICAL STIMULUS, influenced by their\ncultural background. Cultural influences might explain the differences in how people interpret the divine. Human\nprojection shapes the experience but does not cause it.\n• Consider RAIMON PANIKKAR — we need to be 'open' about the truth, rather than making claims about it. Life is a\n'SEARCHING PILGRIMAGE' and we might need to let go of traditions in order to find our identity.\nCHRISTOPHANY is God's way of making Himself known to people. RELIGIOUS PLURALISM is a SPIRITUAL\nPOSITION not an intellectual position.\nA02 Analysis and Evaluation (24 marks)\n• Evaluate the Catholic church view that only by baptism into the church people are saved. COUNCIL of FLORENCE\n(1422) 'The Council firmly believes, professes and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only\npagans, but Jews, heretics and schismatics, cannot participate in eternal life, but will depart into everlasting fire which has\nbeen prepared for the devil and his angels.'\n• Research the VARIETIES of exclusivism. Douglas PRATT divides it into three subdivisions — open, closed and\nextreme. Citing KRAEMER, Pratt says open exclusivism, while never ceding the superior position, 'may at least be\namenably disposed toward the other' (D.

The MONARCH is head of the Church, 26 BISHOPS sit in the House\nof Lords, and every part of the country is served by a PARISH system. Yet religious ceremonies accounted for just 24\nper cent of marriages in 2016, falling by nearly a half (48 per cent) from two decades ago.\n• PROGRAMMATIC secularists like DAWKINS argue that Christianity should have no part in public life. RELIGION\nIS A FORM OF CHILD ABUSE — A child lacking understanding should not be labelled as religious. Dawkins\ncriticised the state for allowing a child below the age of consent and reason to be labelled as religious. They have\nbeen unable to think about the beliefs they are labelled as possessing. This could be seen in school admissions, for\nexample.\n• 6% of secondary schools are Church of England and 10% are Catholic. Many of these are HIGH PERFORMING\nschools with a strong community ethos. Because they draw from wide catchment areas they are an antidote to\nINEQUALITY produced by post code segregation of rich and poor.\n• ROWAN WILLIAMS argues the Church has a role to play in resisting the apparent threat of secularism felt by some\nreligious fundamentalists who are anti-democratic (as they oppose democratic consensus on laws on abortion and\nhomosexuality).\n• The part played in public life includes the role CHRISTIAN VALUES such as SANCTITY of LIFE and JUSTICE play\nin national debates. Christians also support a secularist emphasis on HUMAN RIGHTS.\nA02 Analysis and Evaluation (24 marks)\n• You could analyse and evaluate one or two of the issues such as issues surrounding FAITH SCHOOLS.\n• Supporters argue that state-funded faith schools are among the best-performing schools in the country, inculcating a\nsense of respect, discipline and care for others. Detractors say they are DIVISIVE and often sectarian propounding a\nmisguided world view at odds with the UK's inclusive society made up of people many different faiths and none.\n• Criticism has come from the NATIONAL SECULAR SOCIETY and Humanists UK but also from some religious\nrepresentatives who themselves have argued that faith schools hinder rather than promote community cohesion.\n• Secularists fear that faith schools may be practising a covert form of religious indoctrination, promoting an\nunderstanding of issues — such as abortion, homosexuality, the family, evolution, and WOMEN's RIGHTS— at odds\nwith mainstream British values. To do this, they argue, is dangerous and unhealthy and to do it with secular taxpayers'\nmoney is unfair. Synoptic link with FEMINIST THEOLOGY.\n• With few GRAMMAR SCHOOLS religious schools represent a real path of social advancement and social\nintegration because they do not draw from a geographical catchment area.\n233",

    "content": "Both 'social and economic' and 'from sin' aspects of liberation must happen together. Gutierrez claimed that POLITICAL\nLIBERATION is the work of salvation. He emphasised earthly liberation, whereas JUAN SEGUNDO emphasised spiritual\nliberation.\nThe Bible extracts in the 'key quotations' section allow you to consider how each teaching might have influenced the\ndevelopment of liberation theology. For example, MATTHEW 25:40 - \"whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers\nand sisters of mine, you did for me\" — encourages the PREFERENTIAL OPTION FOR THE POOR in the call to side with\n'ONE OF THE LEAST', i.e. an outcast.\nLiberation theology has its origins in 1960s Latin America, a place of corrupt governments and poverty. Christian groups\nformed to discuss experiences and practical solutions. Liberation theology therefore became a THEOLOGY OF HOPE, with\nGod's love extending both to creation and to liberation.\nLATIN AMERICA had found itself at a crossroads, a significant battleground in the cold war conflict between the USA and\nUSSR. Marx had predicted a violent uprising of the oppressed — this seemed to be happening. Liberation theology focused\non increasing HUMAN WELL-BEING rather than HUMAN MATERIAL WEALTH. This links to Marx's understanding that\nindustrialisation can sacrifice the well-being of humans, despite the increase in wealth.\nLiberation theology's use of Marx here, seems to be that the process of industrialisation is supported by a structure of sin\nthat then forms part of the organisation of society, and in turn, part of the systems of government and education.\nGUTIERREZ warned against using every aspect of Marxism but mentions his theories of alienation and exploitation.\nGutierrez also utilises Marx's suggestion that human beings can change the world they inhabit. Gutierrez considered that\npeople of Latin America wanted to be liberated from capitalism and so he called for the Church to stand with such\nmovements for liberation — BEING CHRISTIAN NECESSITATES BEING POLITICAL. Gutierrez went as far as to say\nthat to not get involved in politics would be equal to helping to keep things the same, even if this situation was wrong/\nundesirable.\n238",

Discuss\nYou need to impose a structure on this answer and then make sure you answer the question — does Liberation Theology rely\ntoo much on Marx? What do we mean by 'too much'?\nA01 Knowledge and Understanding (16 marks)\n• You could use Leonardo BOFF's three mediations to explain that Marxism arguably enters at the FIRST\nMEDIATION — meaning at the level of analysis of unjust social structures and class oppression. Arguably an\nappropriate level rather than 'too much'.\n• First mediation is the SOCIO-ANALYTICAL, which Boff describes as 'seeing'. By employing the ideas of\nALIENATION, false consciousness and historical dialectic (conflict), liberation theology explains why the poor often\nappear passive in their poverty and their apparent powerlessness. Explain these Marxist ideas and how they might\napply to the FLAVELLAS (shanty towns).\n• Boff's second mediation is the HERMENEUTIC (interpreting and judging). At this judging level Boff uses the Bible\nand especially the story of the EXODUS of the children of Israel from the oppressive Pharaoh and the prophetic cry\nfor justice (look up Isaiah for example). Jesus is also seen to be the saviour of outsiders who had a special concern for\nthe poor. \"The first shall be last and the last first\" he said.\n• Boff's third mediation concerns PRACTICE (meaning activity or practical living). After MEDELLIN (the 1968 Mexico\nconference) the church increasingly sided with the poor and began to live alongside the poor in 'base communities'.\nThis was a challenge (or even threat) to the established Catholic hierarchy.\n• Some liberationists even joined the guerrillas (Camilo Torres RESTREPO died fighting in Colombia in 1966 —'if Jesus\nwere alive today he would be a guerillo' he said). The issue of violence was one reason Pope Francis originally gave only\nqualified support for the liberation theologians whilst an Argentinian Cardinal. But Archbishop Romero's murder in\n1980 in San Salvador shocked the Catholic hierarchy who could no longer hold back their condemnation of corrupt\nregimes.\nA02 Analysis and evaluation (24 marks)\n• Arguably liberation theology is still fully grounded in the Bible: \"it's simple, you just read the Bible with the eyes of the\npoor\", (Jon Sobrino).\n• To say that God has a bias towards the poor is not the same as arguing liberation theology is too heavily influenced\nby Marx. \"Nevertheless, God demonstrates a special predilection toward those who have been excluded from the banquet\nof life\", argues Gustavo GUTIERREZ.\n• Marx speaks of a great REVERSAL: \"A recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time, also, the recognition\nof the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up\", Karl Marx.\n• The Bible also speaks of a great reversal where 'the first shall be last and the last first\".

Contrast the situation today with\nthat of 1880: in 1880 homosexuality was illegal, women couldn't easily get divorced, and women could not own\nproperty if they were married.\n• The concept of the family has changed: NUCLEAR families may increasingly be LONE PARENT families, GAY\nMARRIAGE is legal, and may have children through SURROGATES, families frequently have step-parents (or\npartners). The TABOO on having children outside marriage has vanished.\n• The CATHOLIC church opposes GAY MARRIAGE and GAY ADOPTION. MULIERIS DIGNITATEM reaffirms the\nEQUALITY of men and women suggested by GENESIS 1, but also the NATURAL ORDER of difference. The\nrightful opposition of women to what is expressed in the biblical words \"He shall rule over you\" (Genesis 3:16) must\nnot under any condition lead to the \"masculinisation\" of women. In the name of liberation from male \"domination\",\nwomen must not appropriate to themselves male characteristics contrary to their own feminine \"originality\".\n• The CHURCH of ENGLAND is divided between LIBERAL and CONSERVATIVE views. GAY clergy must be\ncelibate. Gay marriage is not allowed in Church. In January 2020 the HOUSE of BISHOPS issued a statement that\n\"sexual relationships outside heterosexual marriage are regarded as falling short of God's purpose for human beings\", and\nthat people in gay or straight civil partnerships should be sexually abstinent, attempting to hold the traditional line.\n• CULTURAL RELATIVISTS argue that values change as attitudes in society change (with changes in our\nunderstanding of human biology we no longer argue, as Aquinas did, that females are 'malformed males').\nCHRISTIANS argue for universal, eternal NORMS which govern these rules. But Christian denominations cannot\nagree between or within themselves what the norms are or what the rules should be.

    "title": "Hermeneutics of Suspicion",
    "content": "Paul RICOEUR (1913-2005) asks us to adopt a HERMENEUTIC OF SUSPICION when reading a text such as the Bible.\nWe need to be suspicious of the MOTIVES, the VALUES, the culture of those who wrote it, and not just project our own\nvalues onto the text. James O'Donnell comments\n\"Liberation means, therefore, to opt for the exercise of an ideological suspicion in order to unmask the unconscious\nideological structures which dominate and which favour a powerful, privileged minority.\" (O'Donnell 1982:32)\nThere is a WORLD BEHIND the text (the culture of Jesus' day) and there is a world IN FRONT of the text, our own\nculture. These TWO HORIZONS (Gadamer's term) need to merge in a valid interpretation that is CRITICAL.\nElizabeth Schussler FIORENZA argues that theology is the product of each writer's experience and that this is determined\nby the historical and SOCIAL CONTEXT of every theologian. Theology is culturally conditioned and shapes, reflects, and\nserves a particular group's or individual's interests, (Fiorenza 1975:616).\nRuether argues that the Bible is riddled with PATRIARCHY and emerged from a world of hierarchy with males in charge.\nThe FEMININE is constructed from these patriarchal values.\nThe social relationships are ARCHAIC and inappropriate for our time: they are reflected in a male clergy and a continued\ntolerance of INJUSTICE and INEQUALITY.\nBehind the interpretation of the Bible lies the acceptance of ARISTOTLE's biology that sees men and women as two\nseparate classes of human and whereby\n\"The female is not only secondary to the male but lacks full human status in physical strength, moral self-control and\nmental capacity. The lesser \"nature\" thus confirms the female's subjugation to the male as her \"natural\" place in the\nuniverse\". (Ruether 1985.65).\nRuether's Hermeneutic\nControlling principle — whatever denigrates women is rejected, whatever builds up and values women is accepted. Then it is\nEXPERIENCE (rather than history) which is the starting-point of theology. The Bible needs to be interpreted anew, and the\nstory of REDEMPTION retold in the light of women's experience. This may be linked to the EXISTENTIAL theology of\nPaul TILLICH.\nThere is a PROPHETIC PRINCIPLE in the Bible which can be rediscovered and brought to the fore: emphasising JUSTICE\nand the call to be a new people of LIBERATION. ISAIAH 60 gives a radical vision of a just world order.\n\"God's Shekinah, Holy Wisdom, the Mother-face of God has fled from the high thrones of patriarchy and has gone into\nexodus with us\". (Ruether, 1985:87).\nThe counter-culture of early Christianity which emphasised this were suppressed, for example, the female PROPHETS\nPriscilla and Maximilla in MONTANISM. Priscilla claimed a night vision in which Christ slept by her side \"in the form of\nwoman, clad in a bright garment\". She adopted a priestly ministry with direct voices and visions from God. Montanists were\npersecuted and ultimately suppressed with violence in the sixth century.\n257",

Ruether ignores the historically-entrenched nature of Christianity, which\n'necessarily has one foot in the past'. Incarnation means that God became a human being at a particular time, within\na patriarchal worldview. That Jesus only chose male apostles may be no accident. Hampson concludes that 'it cannot\nbe the case that God is related in a particular way to a certain history'. Like Daly, Hampson is a post-Christian.",

    "content": "\"Some texts, by their very nature, draw part of their meaning from the actions, history and life with which they are\ninextricably interwoven\". (Thiselton, New Horizons pg 66).\n• Incarnational Doctrine is sexist. God 'sent his son'. Metaphors for God are male (with a few exceptions that are\nnever developed). God calls Jesus 'My Beloved Son, whom I have chosen,' and asks Jesus' followers to 'listen to\nhim' (Luke 9:35). Christian creeds ask us to affirm belief in \"Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord'. Lord and Son are\nboth patriarchal images.\n• Symbolic world is sexist. The revelation of Christ in history is full of patriarchal symbols and messages. The Prodigal\nSon is having property divided between two men (Luke 15:11-35). The Good Samaritan is a male. When Jesus visits\nMartha and Mary, Mary is busy cooking and Martha commended for sitting passively at Jesus' feet, (Luke 1:38-42).\nWomen who were Resurrection witnesses were not believed because the testimony of women is unreliable. Moreover,\nPaul is a Rabbi and retains some of the Levitical symbolic world of Rabbinic Judaism. Hampson points out 'we do not\nhave stories of a man sitting at the feet of a female teacher'. When stories circulate in Corinth of women prophets,\nPaul seeks to suppress the upsurge by writing two letters to the Corinthians, both against women's liberation,\ninsisting 'women keep silent in church' (1 Corinthians 14:34-5).\nHampson therefore accuses Ruether of misrepresenting the profoundly historical nature of Christian patriarchy, which still\naffects Christian theology and practice. Hampson is a POST-CHRISTIAN, Ruether a Christian LIBERATION theologian.",

(Select 'Extracts' from:\nhttp://peped.org/philosophicalinvestigations/christian-thought/feminism/)\nElisabeth Schussler Fiorenza, Sharing Her Word (T &T Clarke, 1998)\nDaphne Hampson, After Christianity (SCM, 2002)\nRosemary Ruether, Sexism and God-talk (Beacon, 1993)\nBible Passages such as 2 Corinthians 11:3 and 1 Tim 2:14 became the argument for the subordination of women, and Mark\n5 and John 8 for Jesus' more liberating attitudes to women. Isaiah 60 gives the prophetic call for justice. Paul in Galatians\n3:16 seems to contradict Ephesians 5. Can they be reconciled?\nHampson, (After Christianity, 2002), states that if Christianity is true, God cannot be thought of as moral or good \"given the\nharm that this myth has done to women\" (Hampson 2002: xv). The Christian myth is misogynistic (Hampson 2002: xvi) and\nmorally suspect (Hampson 2002: vxiii).\n266",

    "title": "Appendix of Technical Terms",
    "content": "Here are definitions of every technical term mentioned in the OCR specification H573/1/2/3.\na posteriori - means 'after experience', or 'from observation'. A posteriori arguments include the teleological\nargument, and the ethical theory of natural law, which derives goodness from observed rational tendencies God has\ndesigned into us.\na priori - means 'before experience\". A priori arguments proceed by logical deduction, for example the ontological\nargument for God's existence, or Kant's theory of ethics.\nabsolutism - 'absolute' means one of three things - a theory is universal (applies to everyone) or that a principle is\nnon-negotiable (unchanging) or that it is objective - tested empirically so beyond dispute.\nact utilitarianism - the utility of an act is its ability to maximise happiness and minimise pain - tested by applying the\ngreatest happiness principle to likely consequences of a single action.\nagape - one of the four loves of Greek ethics, meaning unconditional commitment to friend and stranger, as in Jesus'\nsaying 'greater agape has no-one than this, that a person lay down his life for his friends\" (John 15:13). It is both the\nfoundation principle of situation ethics, and a vital issue in Christian moral principles (Christian Thought).\nanalogy of attribution - Aquinas' view that you can say God is like blazing sun (attribute of purity and light). But it's\nan analogy because there isn't a precise one for one likeness between God and the attribute of light. As God is the cause\nof all good things, God's attributes are simply on a higher level to our own. Hick gave examples of 'upwards' analogy of\nattribution, such as speaking of a dog's faithfulness as analogical to the faithfulness of God.\nanaphatic (or apophatic) way - a philosophical approach to theology which asserts that no fi nite concepts or\nattributes can be adequately used of God, but only negative terms, such as immortal, immutable or invisible. Apophasis\nmeans 'denial, negation' and so 'apophatic' is another word for anaphatic.\nanalogy of proper proportion - A plant has a life, a human has life, God has life - there is a proportionate\nrelationship between each life mentioned in the list, with God's being the greatest and the plants being on a\nproportionately lower level.\nattributes - (divine) qualities of God's character such as omnibenevolence, omnipotence and omniscience. Notice these\ncan be expressed positively as in the via positiva or negatively as in the via negativa (God is immortal, so not mortal,\ninvisible, so not visible).\ncategorical imperative - A term Kant employs to express an unconditional, absolute maxim or command - an\nimperative like 'never lie!'\ncategory error - applying a category from one form of life to another which it cannot refer to - such as 'what colour is\nthe wind?\" The wind never has a colour.\n1",
