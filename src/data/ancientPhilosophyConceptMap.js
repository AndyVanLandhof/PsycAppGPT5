Their inquiries into substance, change, and the cosmos laid the groundwork for later philosophical thought. Key figures include Thales, Anaximander, and Heraclitus.' }, position: { x: 400, y: 0 } },
  { id: 'socrates', data: { label: 'Socrates', description: 'A foundational figure in Western philosophy, Socrates shifted focus to ethics and human behavior. He is known for the Socratic method—questioning to stimulate critical thinking—and for his influence on Plato. Socrates left no writings; his ideas are known through his students.' }, position: { x: 400, y: 120 } },
  { id: 'plato', data: { label: 'Plato', description: 'Student of Socrates and founder of the Academy in Athens, Plato developed the Theory of Forms and wrote philosophical dialogues. His work addresses justice, reality, knowledge, and the ideal state. Plato\'s influence extends through his student Aristotle.' }, position: { x: 400, y: 240 } },
  { id: 'forms', data: { label: 'Theory of Forms', description: 'Plato\'s metaphysical theory posits that non-physical Forms (or Ideas) represent the most accurate reality. Physical objects are mere shadows of these perfect Forms. The theory addresses questions about universals, knowledge, and the nature of reality.' }, position: { x: 200, y: 360 } },
  { id: 'cave', data: { label: 'Allegory of the Cave', description: 'A story in Plato\'s Republic illustrating the difference between the world of appearances and the world of Forms. Prisoners in a cave mistake shadows for reality, symbolizing human ignorance. The allegory explores enlightenment, education, and the philosopher\'s role.' }, position: { x: 200, y: 480 } },
  { id: 'aristotle', data: { label: 'Aristotle', description: 'Student of Plato and tutor to Alexander the Great, Aristotle founded his own school, the Lyceum. He developed the Four Causes and the concept of the Prime Mover. Aristotle\'s works cover logic, ethics, metaphysics, and natural sciences.' }, position: { x: 600, y: 360 } },
  { id: 'causes', data: { label: 'Four Causes', description: 'Aristotle\'s framework for explaining change and existence: material, formal, efficient, and final causes. This approach analyzes why things exist or happen, influencing later scientific and philosophical thought. The Four Causes are central to Aristotle\'s metaphysics.' }, position: { x: 600, y: 480 } },
  { id: 'mover', data: { label: 'Prime Mover', description: 'Aristotle\'s concept of the ultimate cause of motion and change in the universe. The Prime Mover is pure actuality, unchanging, and the final cause of everything. This idea addresses questions about the origin and purpose of existence.' }, position: { x: 600, y: 600 } },

  { id: 'e1', source: 'pre-socratics', target: 'socrates', label: 'influenced', data: { rationale: 'The Pre-Socratic philosophers laid the groundwork for critical thinking and natural explanations, paving the way for Socrates\' focus on ethics and epistemology. Their move from myth to reason set the stage for Socratic inquiry. Socrates built upon their questions about reality and knowledge.' } },
  { id: 'e2', source: 'socrates', target: 'plato', label: 'taught', data: { rationale: 'Socrates was Plato\'s teacher and a profound influence on his thinking. Plato\'s dialogues often feature Socrates as the main character, exploring philosophical questions. The Socratic method and focus on virtue are central to Plato\'s works.' } },
  { id: 'e3', source: 'plato', target: 'forms', label: 'developed', data: { rationale: 'Plato developed the Theory of Forms to explain the difference between the changing physical world and unchanging reality. Influenced by Socratic dialogues, he argued that true knowledge comes from understanding these perfect Forms. The theory addresses universals and the nature of knowledge.' } },
  { id: 'e4', source: 'plato', target: 'aristotle', label: 'taught', data: { rationale: 'Plato taught Aristotle at the Academy, shaping his early philosophical development. Although Aristotle later diverged from Plato\'s ideas, the teacher-student relationship was foundational. Aristotle\'s critiques of Plato\'s Forms reflect this intellectual lineage.' } },
  { id: 'e5', source: 'forms', target: 'cave', label: 'illustrated by', data: { rationale: 'The Allegory of the Cave is Plato\'s vivid illustration of the Theory of Forms. It shows how most people perceive only shadows of reality, while philosophers seek true knowledge. The allegory explores enlightenment, ignorance, and the transformative power of education.' } },
  { id: 'aristotle_forms', source: 'aristotle', target: 'forms', label: 'criticized', data: { rationale: 'Aristotle criticized Plato\'s Theory of Forms, arguing that forms exist within objects, not in a separate realm. He believed knowledge comes from studying the natural world. This critique marks a major philosophical shift from Plato\'s idealism to Aristotle\'s empiricism.' } },
  { id: 'e6', source: 'aristotle', target: 'causes', label: 'developed', data: { rationale: 'Aristotle developed the Four Causes to explain why things exist and change. This framework analyzes material, form, agent, and purpose. It became a cornerstone of Western philosophy and science, influencing explanations of causality for centuries.' } },
  { id: 'e7', source: 'aristotle', target: 'mover', label: 'developed', data: { rationale: 'Aristotle\'s Prime Mover is the ultimate cause of all motion and change. It is pure actuality, unchanging, and the final cause of everything in the universe. This concept addresses the need for a first cause and the nature of existence.' } },
